# The Lion's Breath
- Pranayama is an ancient breathing practice originating from yogic traditions in India.
- The Lion's Breath is a form of Pranayama that has been shown to eliminate stress.

## How to do it:
- That is one "rep" of the technique.
	- Sit in a comfortable position with a slight forward lean and your hands on the floor.
	- Focus your gaze on the tip of your nose.
	- Inhale deeply through your nose.
	- Open your mouth, stick your tongue out and down to your chin.
	- Exhale forcefully with a "HA!" sound.
- You'll want to take a few normal breaths through your nose with a relaxed face after each rep.
- Repeat this process 5-10 times, depending on time and your level of practice.
- Limit the forcefulness of the exhale if you're a beginner.

## Benefits:
- The benefits of this technique are immense:

	- Opens up the face, neck, and chest muscles.
