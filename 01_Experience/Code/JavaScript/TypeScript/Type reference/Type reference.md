- TypeScript auto assign type of the variable when created

```ts
let a = 5; // variable 'a' is assigned as 'number'
// equivalent to: let a: number = 5;
a = '3'; // Error: a is assigned as 'number', therefore, cannot pass a string to it
a = 2.4; // OK: 2.4 is a 'number', all numbers in JavaScript is float
```
