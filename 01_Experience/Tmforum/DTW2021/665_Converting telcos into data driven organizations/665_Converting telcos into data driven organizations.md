# Vodafone:
- 3 huge volume of high-value data: ![[Tmforum/DTW2021/665_Converting telcos into data driven organizations/003_Vodafone data and analytics strategy.png]]
	- Network
	- Customers
	- IoT
- Monetize data based on 2 main initiatives:
	- Internal data monetization -> Underpin all customers value management activities
	- External data monetization:
		- Enhanced core connectivity services
		- New digital data products
- Internal: 3 types of services: ![[Tmforum/DTW2021/665_Converting telcos into data driven organizations/002_Vodafone 3 types of services.png]]
	- PaaS: Put all data from all source into 1 data ocean
	- Data ssS: all teams use the same data asset
	- Analytics and AI aaS: follow use cases from the start, work as one team and provide suitable analytic and AI approach: ![[Tmforum/DTW2021/665_Converting telcos into data driven organizations/003_Vodafone data and analytics strategy.png]]
- External: 
	- Generate mobility and location insights: ![[Tmforum/DTW2021/665_Converting telcos into data driven organizations/004_Vodafone location analytics products.png]]

# Verizon:
![[Tmforum/DTW2021/665_Converting telcos into data driven organizations/Verizon digital twins evolution.png]]
- Emulation: Mimic the outward behaviors of other systems without accurately reflecting the internal state (same inputs -> same outputs)
	- Goal: replace the other system
- Stimulation: Model internal state of other systems, a good stimulation will emulate the target.
	- Goal: model the other system

# Axiata, Telefonica, Telstra
- 3 Questions
	- The biggest recent government challenge and how did you tackle it?
	- 1 piece of best practice regard the previous problem
	- Data governance challenges when combine AI, IoT and cloud.

## Axiata

- 1:
	- One of top evolving areas is complexity of regulatory developments
	- After solving it, there are 3 focused area:
		- Ensure data privacy and cybersecurity while balancing product innovation and custom experience
		- Develop appropriate data model underpin by AI and ML while changing culture and building team
		- Data ethics how to ethically process the data and implement technology
	- 3 approaches for solutions:
		- Harmonize policies and frameworks standards and government instruments -> Consistency, speed of execution, leveraging economy
		- Perform independent assessment against the standard framework to understand current strength, maturity and capability for doing future aspirations
		- Adopt common a common architecture on a technology landscape
- 2:
	- Prioritization:
		- Focus on highest business valued and broadest enterprise used data assets
- 3:
	- Target the right information maturity level
	- Define information ownership model to maintain data quality, integrity and accuracy and how to scale it
	- Data security and privacy
	- Responsibilities of each partner
	- => Use the success of data governance on risk mitigation, efficiency improvement, value creation to drive the adoption of AI, IoT and cloud.

## Telefonica
54:00

- 1:
	- Biggest challenges is control change:
		- The old data analyzers afraid that data governance will steal their jobs
- 2:
	- The goal is to manage data as an organizational (affect the whole organization) asset
	- -> Show the important of data driven and data governance to people, especially the stakeholders
	- What is the experiences:
		- Need executive supports
		- Choose the data that relevant to people, to user
		- Governance strategy is aligned with business strategy
		- Keep data governance relevant with business
		- Organizational changes is important
		- In data management, find the balance between urgent and important
- 3:
	- Data quality is the basic that should be taken care of first
	- Data privacy
	- Cloud: pay attention to information volume, computer power, latency and cost
	- Unorganized data may cause cloud migration slow and expensive

# Telstra

- 1:
	- Demonstrate the value of data governance:
		- Find key values: ![[01_Experience/Tmforum/DTW2021/665_Converting telcos into data driven organizations/6 key results of data governance.png]]
	- Get senior leadership involvement: target executive data owners of each business function
		- Educate and align
		- Monthly meeting to share problems and solutions
	- Get people to do new data job day to day
- 2:
	- Reinforce the important of data governance
	- Using real example of what data governance can do to solve existing problems is effective to convince senior leaders
- 3:
	- Don't get distracted by technology, think fundamentally
	- -> Focus on data not the systems or technologies
	- Getting good result from AI, IoT, cloud needs good data governance

# Charlotte Patrick consult

- Most common problem about data is how to use data in data silos then culture issues
- Lack of skills and experts is the second biggest issues after data
- Much value of data comes from how to make the network better
- Data governance still faces a lot of problems and will stay high priority in 5-10 years
- A lot of telcos hesitate to join data ecosystem (sharing data with others)

# AWS
- Telco journey to data centricity
	1. Modernize data infrastructure: use purposeful databases and serve data services
		- ![[01_Experience/Tmforum/DTW2021/665_Converting telcos into data driven organizations/AWS data architecture in cloud.png]]
	2. Liberate data: so everybody can use the data
	3. Innovate with AI: Drive insights and values
		- ![[01_Experience/Tmforum/DTW2021/665_Converting telcos into data driven organizations/AWS AI stack for telco.png]]
- Changes 5G brings
	- Open new ways to use data for developing new services
	- Make implementing modern data architecture and AI/ML techniques easy and efficient
	- Changes
		- Data explosion
			- More data for monetization
		- Dynamic network -> Hard to manage
		- Mobile edge computing
		- Newer consumption models -> more business
		- New standards support
		- Security threats
