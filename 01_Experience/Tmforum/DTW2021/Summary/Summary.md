- Implementing AI in Telco:
	- There is no standardize approach for implementing AI in Telco. It depends a lot on company's culture
	- Telcos need to understand that it is a long-term approach:
		- Start small
		- Benefit will not come immediately
		- Open to failure
	- These changes need executive level support and commitment across the organization, not 1 person or 1 department's job
- Autonomous network:
	- The Autonomous Networks Project aims to define fully automated zero wait, zero touch, zero trouble innovative network/ICT services for vertical industriesâ€™ users and consumers, supporting self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimizing and self-evolving telecom network infrastructures for telecom internal users: planning, service/marketing, operations and management.
