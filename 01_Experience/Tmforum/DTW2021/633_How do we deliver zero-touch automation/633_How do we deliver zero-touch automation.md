- 2nd largest number of end users (behind China Mobile)
	- 
- 3 things that they are aiming for
	-  Everything is automated
		- With their large number of platforms, customers, they aim to have every single thing automated
		- The average time to solve an issue manually is 3-3.5 hours (react, login, solve) (without accounting human's mistake while fixing) -> Long, customer's frustration 
			- An issue is anything that affects customer experience: slow network, no signal spot, ....
		- The bot can do the same amount of work in less than 3 mins

	-  Focus on structural fixed
		-  2 types of fixes:
			-  Immediate (temporary) fix -> technical debts, landmines, zombie issues (that happens multiple times)
			-  Long-term fix -> The error will never occur again
			-  Operators tend to fix the problem temporarily and move on
		-  They try both fixes with every issues

	- ?
		- The platform is heterogeneous, hybrid, complex landscape
		- The platform must be open, anyone can operate and use it

- Building the KPI based on the customer satisfactory, with the agreement of both operation and business teams
- The KPI (and solution) is data-driven: Dig deep into every single customer feedback to data mine

- Results
	- With the new approach, they reduce the amount of outages by more than 90%.
	- Order fallout reduce by 99%, 90% solved by human, 9% solved by Bot
	- Overall 85% reduction: 50% IT tickets reduced, 35% handled byh Bot
	- 80% reduction of bill appending, 0 bill got stuck longer than 7 days
	- 60% reduction in customer calls

- Unique innovations
	- One click billing platform using by all operator teams
	- Customer experience tracking by collecting all customer transaction into 1 data lake to analyze and find key improvements

- Future goals
	- 0 customer calls
	- Bit can predict problems and handle them before they occur
	- Replace old platforms with zero touch, cloud ones

# Vodafone: Digital transformation
![[Tmforum/DTW2021/633_How do we deliver zero-touch automation/Vodafone what will digital transformation bring.png]]
- Drivers and key product
	-  Data driven solutions -> Data driven decisions
	-  Build and don't buy mentality
	-  Automation and simplicity
	-  Digital culture transformation


# Nokia: Nokia's network anomaly detection solution
![[Tmforum/DTW2021/633_How do we deliver zero-touch automation/Nokia anomaly detection evolution.png]]
- 4 problems in the past
	-  architect ...
		- The architecture has been vertically indicated, part-centric approach
	-  Data
		- 70-80% of effort spends on data
		- source, structure, where data exposed
	-  Tools
		- Cope with the change of tools
	-  Approach

# Full end-to-end network automation
- 5 key building blocks
	-  Inventory
	-  Orchestration
	-  Powerful Computation
	-  Assurance and analytic
	-  Rule based to AI driven

- Effect:
	-  Greatly reduce serving time (from register to actually get it)

	-  Network orchestration (on net)
		-  receive orders from OSS and BSS layers
		-  provision service quality
	-  Business automation (off net)
	-  order and provision services on multiple domains

- Where to start
	-  From data: breaking down the data silos 	- > service inventory
	-  From architecture: Changing the old, complex architecture (integration system) into hierarchical-approach one (open digital architecture, NES-based model)

	-  Get on cloud ???
	-  Change all >< Change things at steps, start with things that have motivations (like 5G services, O-RAN)

- Closed loop??

- Automation is not removing human but augmenting human (enable human to do better things)

# Difficulties

- Standardize network functions is required for automation but it will take a lot of efforts
- No completed solution yet -> telcos afraid to start
