# Telefonica

- Be clear how to measure economic impacts from the start
- 3 ways to measure economy impacts:
	- Use open source software at the beginning
	- Work on new things that can be done now with data
	- (no talk)
- Telco collecting data:
	- Collecting data is expensive so choose what you need
	- Define the use cases and make sure required data is available
	- Define which data will be used in an app before building the app
- Company should follow use case-driven strategy (faster return) instead of data-driven one, but they should look at the future (make data reusable, ...)
- When starting the data journey, companies will put everything together, especially data but also analytic and AI . However as they mature, the data will still stay at the center but the value creating analytic move back to the business.
- Privacy: Telefonica create transparency center to let users know what their personal data is used for so that users can give consent of those usages
	- Consumers only show concern about privacy when asked but in daily life, they have limited interest in that area.
