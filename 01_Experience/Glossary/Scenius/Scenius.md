# TLDR

- **Genius** = great ideas come from lone individuals
- **Scenius** = great ideas come from groups of creative individuals

# Scenius
- There are a lot of destructive myths about creativity, but one of the most dangerous is the "**lone genius**" myth
	- The lone genius myth: An individual with superhuman talents appears out of nowhere at certain points in history, free of influences or precedent, with a direct connection to God or The Muse
	- If you believe in the lone genius myth, creativity is an antisocial act, performed by only a few great figures
- There’s a healthier way of thinking about creativity that the musician Brian Eno refers to as "**scenius**"
	- Under this model, great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals who make up an "**ecology of talent**"
	- If you look back closely at history, many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were actually part of "a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other’s work, copying from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas."
	- Being a valuable part of a scenius is not necessarily about how smart or talented you are, but about **what you have to contribute**
