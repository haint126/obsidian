# Previous experiment

- What is the previous experiment?
- What went wrong that is expected to solve here?
- How to solve it (the changes comparing to the previous experiment)


# Data collecting process

- Where do you get the data?
- How do you get the data?
- Where is the data stored?

# Data detail

- Number of classes 
- Number of instances in each class
- Anything special about data (Imbalance, Mistake, etc)
- Label detail:
	- Label format
	- How to map labels with data?
	- Is there anything special about labels?


# Data augmentation

- Any changes from source data (Cleaning, Filling, Fixing, etc)
- Data augmentation using for training (with detailed parameters)


# Data assumption (analysis)

- What is the definition of each class?
- How to differentiate those classes?
- Feature engineering:
	- New features?
	- Feature relationship
	- Which feature to focus
- How to get expected results?
	- Which feature needs to exist?
	- Which relationship needs to exist?

# Metrics

- Model training metrics and how to calculate them (Accuracy, mAP, etc)
- Business metrics and how to calculate them (Correct examples,  counting, etc)
- Expected (accepted) threshold for each metric

# Environment setup

- Which environment is used to run the code (conda, virtual env, colab)?
- How do you setup the environment?
- How to activate the environment to use?
- What libraries do you use?
- For each library:
	- Version
	- How to get it
	- How to setup and use it

# Model

- Where do you get the model?
- How do you get the model?
- Where is the model code stored?
- Where do you get the pretrained weight?
- How do you get the pretrained weight?
- Where is the pretrained weight stored?
- Any model code changes compared to the source
- How to initiate the base value?
- How to control the randomness?
- Which loss function is used?
- Which optimizer is used?
- Hyperparameters setting (type, value, where to apply)?
- Training setup?
	- Where to load model?
	- Where to load data?
	- Where to run the training?
	- Where is logs stored?
	- Where is checkpoint stored?
	- Where is result model stored?

# Result

- Training metric results
- Business metric results
- Training graphs


# Conclusion

- Results meet expectation or not
- What goes right?
- What goes wrong?
- Explain the results
- Solution for existing problems

# Next experiment

- What will be tested next?


# Side note

- Purpose of this document is to enable
	- Building the resulted model from scratch
	- Remake the process of achieving final model
