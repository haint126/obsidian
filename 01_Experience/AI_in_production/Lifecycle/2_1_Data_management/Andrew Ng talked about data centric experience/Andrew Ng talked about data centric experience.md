# Foundation models
- Foundation models are very large models, trained on very large data sets, that can be tuned for specific applications.
- GPT-3 is an example of a foundation model for NLP
- Computer vision has not have a foundation model yet

# Data-driven ~~
- Having 50 thoughtfully engineered examples can be sufficient to explain to the neural network what you want it to learn

- There is a need for a tool which can draw your attention to the subset of data thatâ€™s inconsistent


# Making customers their own AI experts

- Create a tool for the customers so they can fine-tune their model on their own
	- Example: [LandingLens platform](https://landing.ai/platform/)
