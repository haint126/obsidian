# How to split machine learning projects:
1. Project scoping
2. Data definition and preparation
3. Model training and error analysis
4. Deployment, monitoring, and maintenance

# Here are 33 questions that most people forget to ask

## Project scoping
- What problem are we trying to solve? 
- Why does it need to be solved?
- Do we truly need machine learning for this?
- What constraints do we have?
- What are the risks?
- What's the best approach to solving this?
- How do we measure progress?
- What does success look like?
- How is our solution going to impact people?
- What could go wrong with our solution?
- What's the simplest version we could build?

## Data definition and preparation
- What data do we need?
- How are we going to get it?
- How frequently does it change?
- Do we trust the source?
- How is this data biased?
- Can we improve it somehow?
- How are we going to clean it?
- How are we going to augment it?

## Model training and error analysis
- What's a good baseline?
- What's a good starting point?
- Has anyone solved this before?
- How are we going to test the model?
- Are the results good enough?
- Are we solving the problem?
- How can we improve the results?

## Deployment, monitoring, and maintenance
- Where do we host this?
- How much do we need to scale? 
- What metrics should we monitor?
- What results do we expect?
- How is the model doing?
- How do we keep the model up to date?
- What's our rollback strategy?
