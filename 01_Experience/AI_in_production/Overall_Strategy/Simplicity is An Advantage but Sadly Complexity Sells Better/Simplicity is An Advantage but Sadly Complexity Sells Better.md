# Why does complexity sell better?
- Complexity signals effort
- Complexity signals mastery
- Complexity signals innovation
- Complexity signals more features

# Why is simplicity an advantage?
- Simple ideas and features are easier to understand and use
- Simple systems are easier to build and scale
- Simple systems have lower operational costs
- Specific to machine learning, simple techniques don’t necessarily perform worse than more sophisticated ones

# What’s wrong with rewarding complexity?
- It incentivizes people to make things unnecessarily complicated
- It also encourages the “not invented here” mindset

# How should we think about complexity instead?
- The objective should be to solve complex problems with as simple of a solution as possible.
- Instead of having a complex, catch-all solution, consider multiple focused solutions
