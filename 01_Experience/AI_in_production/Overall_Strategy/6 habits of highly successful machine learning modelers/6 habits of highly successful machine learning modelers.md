# TLDR
1. Raw data observation => Spend hours
2. Model evaluation => Characteristics of good model
3. Smart baselines => Baseline suitable with expectation
4. Strong starting points => Select the most suitable group of models to try
5. Rapid iteration => Best way to choose best model from above group
6. Error analysis => Tailor solutions for model's errors


# 1. Observation of raw data
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) by plotting is great.
- EDA by looking at thousands of samples is the best.
- EDA is for becoming one with your data, with all of its bumps and sharp edges. This is how to do it.
- This should be done over *many hours*, not minutes.


# 2. Ingenious model evaluation
- The best modelers are the best model evaluators.
- If there was a Venn Diagram of the two groups, it would be a circle.
- This is a skill that anyone can learn, but it takes several hundred hours of modeling experience to become an expert.


# 3. Smart baselines
- Predicting the mean works, but is it the best baseline?
- The best know to use better benchmarks, such as human performance and intelligent heuristics.
- The best model is the simplest, so always start there.


# 4. Starting strong
- Think of the potential solutions to an ML problem as a nearly-infinite tree.
- The most successful modelers can prune all but 0.1% of that tree before they even start.


# 5. Rapid iteration
- If we could know what techniques would work before attacking a problem, then we wouldn't need data scientists.
- After pruning the bad ideas out, the best modelers most efficiently search the remaining possibilities to land on the best solution.

# 6. Error analysis
- The only reliable way of improving your models is by thoroughly analyzing their predictions.
- The average modeler stares at their error metric and hopes it gets better.
- The best know hope is not a strategy, and they tailor solutions to their model's errors.
