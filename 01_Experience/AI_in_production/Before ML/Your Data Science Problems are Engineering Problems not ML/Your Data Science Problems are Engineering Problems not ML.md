# TLDR
- If you have a bad system, priority fixing it before thinking about getting value out of it.
- Your system should enable ML before actually apply ML


# Value formula
- Value = Data + Business Insights + **Engineering**

- When executives and startups think about data science and machine learning many underestimate the complexity because the process _**seems**_ simple.

# Great Engineering enables Great Data Science
- No amount of artificial intelligence and algorithms can fix broken data and systems
- It’s well cited that 80% of a data scientist’s time is spent cleaning data, which reflects the complexity of the code and systems around data management.
- Every data source has its own design and complexity.
	- Which means a lot of work has to be done to unify it into that precious clean data

# So what can you do about it?

## 1. Don’t hire data scientists if you have bad systems
- Both parties will end up wildly disappointed so this will save everyone time and career regret


## 2. Audit the state of your software and systems
- I’d recommend hiring someone with a technical background to
	- Understand your infrastructure
	- Tell you whether your project can be realistically accomplished
	- Tell you how much it will cost and how long it will take

## 3. Hire engineers to fix your bad systems
- It is extremely hard
- However, if you don't fix your bad systems, only failure awaits you

## 4. Start simple and with a small team of data analysts
- It is much more valuable to understand your data before building models
- Simple solutions can already take you quite far
	- -> Hold off on the advanced work until your infrastructure can realistically support it.

## 5. Scale your Data Science team proportional to your impact
- Things take time, so grow your team at a moderate pace
