# TLDR of TLDR
- Using "promotion criteria" instead of "hiring criteria"
- Ask deeper into specific answer, focus on level 3 factors, pick up level 2 factors on the way
- Avoid bias, by either getting opinions from multiple people or give more "interview"

>-   Using promotion criteria to guide hiring criteria
>-   Having the hiring manager do the first interview
>-   Saving synchronous time for interaction, not coding
>-   Using take-home exercises as part of the initial screen

>When I set out to create a better process, I had several goals:
>-   Measure candidates on criteria that matter
>-   Reduce candidate stress to get better signal
>-   Make efficient use of everyone‚Äôs time

# TLDR

- Traditional interview aims to hire "the best" but is more worried about making a bad hire than missing out on a good candidate.
- Traditional interview is bias by the interviewers and the content usually has nothing to do with real job.
- As a result, it consumes more time to hire a "good" candidate ("the best"), leads the recruitment process to a competitive (irrelevant content) and scares off potential candidates who have stable job (bias).
- Changing the current hiring process for the company as a whole is hard => Better to do own experiment.
- Looking for candidate through "promotion criteria" instead of "hiring criteria" (more of level 3 criteria)
- Interview scorecard (interview result) should contains one or two focused level 3 criteria, and any level 2 criteria that come up in the interview.
- ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì The hiring manager should be the one to interview first, after the recruiter, before any other team members
- One-on-one "white board" interview is bad as it is bias (some people are good at it, others are not) and the questions are usually irrelevant.
- During the interview:
	- Focus on level 3 factors (attitudes, behaviors)
	- Pick up level 2 factors (specific skills, experiences) in passing
	- Usually ignore resume
	- Dig deep into specifics of a candidate‚Äôs answers to
		- Find out interesting things about other level 3 or level 2 issues.
		- See if the answer has substance or is shallow.
	- Give a take-home exercise directly to "good" candidates
	- Use scorecard to re evaluate other candidates to confirm moving forward or not (in order to avoid making snap rejections in the moment)
- Take-home exercise should take no longer than an in-person interview and is related to the job you expecting the candidate to do.
- There should always be a feedback for the take-home exercise.
- Onsite schedule should has a balance between technical and non-technical interviews. 
- Create a "Guide to interview" and review it before each interview.


# No one sets out to hire the average

A normal hiring process usually aims to hire only ‚Äúthe best‚Äù. In reality, this is unrealistic, myopic, and terribly prone to bias. But it‚Äôs probably the same goal your organization has and it leads most everyone to the same terrible processes.

The reasons why companies interview the way they do:
-   Everyone wants to find the best in whatever pool of candidates they have.
-   Everyone is more worried about making a bad hire than missing out on a good candidate.
-   Most interviews have nothing to do with what candidates will do in the job or what will make them successful.
-   Most interviewers aren't well-trained and don't prepare.
-   Most interviewers don't want to be outliers from their peers.

=> As a result, *most people interview with a conscious or unconscious intention of finding reasons not to make an offer*.
=> Interviewers are biased towards safety ‚Äì towards candidates who resemble themselves or people already at the company.
=> The typical style of interview provides little signal for assessing if someone will be a good or bad hire.

=> This way is tailor-made for hiring "safe" candidates from overrepresented groups whose best skill is good at interviewing. Many companies think this is good enough.

=> However, it leads to less diverse hiring and other problems, which are **slow and expensive recruiting**

- Being over-selective for "safe" candidates means you have to interview a lot more people to find ones that pass the filter.
=> Spend more time on interviewing
=> Less time on productive development

- Good interviewers are also good at interviewing at other companies.
=> The ones that pass your filter probably pass filters elsewhere.
=> Competitive hiring.
==> Spend more on compensation cost.
==> Losing a competitive situation wastes all interviewing hours.

- Experienced candidates üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è who are doing well and secure in a job would less likely to spent a lot of time on interview prep and then interview with a high chance of being rejected for arbitrary reasons.
=> Losing potential experienced worker.

# Changing interview processes is hard.

Change is hard for institutions. It‚Äôs risky for anyone to deviate from the way things are always done because the personal consequences of breaking something that works is scarier than the reward that comes from making things better.

=> Its better to run your own experiment.


# To find the best candidates, look to your promotion criteria.

Many hiring processes are wasted because they‚Äôre sifting for the wrong criteria. My company‚Äôs interviewer training course talked about three levels of hiring assessment:
1.  appearance, manners, expressions, interests, resume (DON‚ÄôT USE THESE)
2.  knowledge, skills, experience, education, references
3.  determination, motivation, endurance, communication, integrity


We then did a fascinating exercise, setting aside interviewing criteria and brainstorming what characteristics would get someone promoted. For example:
-   For a junior role: follows directions, asks good questions, writes readable code, makes few obvious error, shows attention to detail.
-   For a senior role: identifies alternatives, weighs tradeoffs, tailors work to business goals, communicates clearly, pushes back appropriately, teaches best practices, can move between projects and technologies.
=> Notice how these are mostly level 3 criteria? (Particularly at the senior level.)



# The success of a hire isn't based on what they do in their first week or first month.


- A hire is successful if they show value over time.
=> We promote those employees!
=> We should apply "promotion criteria" instead of "hiring criteria" during the interview and assessment process.

Almost every interview scorecard focused mostly on level 2 criteria. So you need to write your own.

In my guide for interviewers (which I‚Äôll discuss later), I asked people to pick one or two level 3 criteria to focus on, and then note any level 2 criteria that come up in the interview. Different interview types might probe for _some_ level 2 specifics. And I said it was fine to leave scorecard categories blank if they didn‚Äôt come up.

Here is a slightly redacted copy of the scorecard. Feel free to use it as a model, but please customize the criteria for what‚Äôs important to you.


## Sample Interview Scorecard

Guide to interviewers: This scorecard emphases level 3 and level 2 criteria. Interview questions and discussion can‚Äôt cover all the elements below, but should be chosen to provide signal on these criteria.

-  Level 3: Execution
	-   Handles complexity and uncertainty
	-   Makes good delivery tradeoffs
	-   Takes initiative/is self-directed
-  Level 3: Personal Growth
	-   Learns from failure/feedback
	-   Seeks out new challenges
	-   Strives for mastery
-  Level 3: Collaboration
	-   Is intellectually honest
	-   Lifts skills/output of others
	-   Strong opinions, but low ego
-  Level 2: Coding Exercise Only
	-   Correctness
	-   Design
	-   Efficiency
	-   Factoring/structure
	-   Readability
	-   Robustness
	-   Testing
-  Level 2: Design Exercise Only
	-   Communication of ideas
	-   Covers boundary cases
	-   Creativity/inventiveness
	-   Engagement/curiosity
	-   Good questions
	-   Good tradeoffs
	-   Right level of abstraction/detail
-  Level 2: Knowledge/Experience
	-   Agile development
	-   Concurrency/parallelism
	-   Mentoring
	-   Network programming
	-   Open source development
	-   Coding language of interest (e.g. Go, Python, C++, etc.)
	-   Technical leadership
	-   Technical writing


# The hiring manager should lead from the front.

- As hiring manager, if I‚Äôm not comfortable making a hire, it‚Äôs not going to happen.
=> So if I wait until the end of the process, I've just wasted hours of my team‚Äôs time on interviews if I decide against a hire.
By interviewing first, I‚Äôm confident that my team‚Äôs time is well spent. In the next round, the team validates my assessment, digging deeper into the details to confirm my initial willingness to hire or to convince me otherwise.

- Moving a candidate from a phone screen (interviewing to practical) is also a place where bias can creep in. Using a single assessment to decide the recruitment means the assessment needs to be as thorough and unbiased as possible.
==> It should be the responsibility of the most experienced interviewer (which is the hiring manager) to decide the assessment.
==> Moreover, if my pipeline is biased in the phone screen, I need to own that and not put the responsibility (and blame) on another engineer on the team.

- The other responsibility I owned was rejection.
=> The hiring manager should be the one to tell the candidates, not the recruiters. It is preferred to phone them not emailing as it is a way to treat them with respect.


# Save synchronous time for interaction, and let people code in private.

Getting rid of one-on-one ‚Äúwhiteboard‚Äù style interviews for testing a candidate‚Äôs coding skill is also a way to efficiently make use of time and reduce candidate stress.

In these traditional coding interviews:
- Algorithmic-puzzle, white-board questions are unrepresentative of how they solve your problem when you hire them.
- Finding how someone performs in an extremely unnatural, high-stress environment is also not helping as in reality:
	- It‚Äôs pretty rare to do your day to day work with someone looking over your shoulder.
	- Some studies show that those coding in private do much better on assessment criteria.

=> Two ways to handle coding assessment:
- During the initial screening, I asked candidates to do a short take-home exercise.
- I let candidates code in private, and then we discussed their work with several engineers in a group code review.



# Only give a take-home if they pass a non-technical phone screen.

The first phone screen (which should be done by the hiring management as mention above) after the recruiter screen are "non-technical" interviews, which only means they didn't involve coding or systems design. There‚Äôs plenty of technical content in the conversation itself.

- In these interviews, I focused mostly on level 3 factors (attitudes, behaviors) and try to pick up level 2 factors (specific skills, experiences) in passing.
- I usually ignored the resume except to give me some clues for things to probe about ‚Äì jumping off points for conversation ‚Äì and I tried to derail a candidate walking me through the resume point by point because that‚Äôs an utter waste of time in an interview.

>Never be afraid to interrupt a candidate and redirect the conversation. You have very little time in an interview so don‚Äôt waste it on things that aren't giving you signal. Be polite about it, but be in charge. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I need to interrupt. Being mindful of time, I want to shift gears and talk about ‚Ä¶‚Äù

Before the interview, I would prepare two or three questions to get at some of the level 3 factors I want to focus on. **During the interview, I kept digging into specifics of a candidate‚Äôs answers to find out interesting things about other level 3 or level 2 issues**. (‚ÄúTell me more‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat happened next‚Ä¶?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat did you already know about that when you started? What did you need to learn? How did you do that?") By going deep, I could see if the answer has substance or is shallow.

For example, if someone was telling me about a project, I might ask about the stakeholders or business goals, or about design tradeoffs they made, or ask for an explanation of some particular technical factor (‚ÄúI‚Äôm not familiar with embedded software power profile testing; can you explain more about how that works?"). Or I might ask about who did what. **This is particularly important for someone who talks about projects using ‚Äúwe‚Äù.**

> Candidate: ‚ÄúWe did X, then we did Y‚Äù.
> 
> Me: ‚ÄúThat sounds like a lot of work. How many people were on the team? ‚Ä¶ What did each person work on? ‚Ä¶ What did you work on, specifically?‚Äù

If I was concerned about a particular skill or experience, I might pick on the resume that seems like it would give insight into what they know.

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really curious about Project X. I know every project has roadblocks and speed bumps ‚Äì what were some memorable ones you encountered on Project X? ‚Ä¶ Tell me more‚Ä¶ \[go deep into tech details\]. ‚Ä¶ What did you learn from that experience? ‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs another project where you were able to apply that insight? ‚Ä¶ How did it work out?‚Äù


The goal of this kind of interview was to decide whether I could imagine hiring them if further interviews go well.
- If I didn't think I would or I wasn't sure, I _wouldn't_ tell them at the interview. 
=> Instead, I would take time after the interview as I was writing up the scorecard to reflect more deeply on what I heard and confirm my decision not to move forward.
=>I think this is an important step to avoid making snap rejections in the moment when unconscious bias is more likely to be a factor.

- If I did think I‚Äôd hire if other interviews went well, then at the end of the interview, I would invite them to do a take-home exercise.
=> I was willing to make a snap judgement (and risk bias) in this case because I think the value of sustaining momentum in the conversation and inviting to the take-home live outweighs the downside.
=>If I was too optimistic in my initial assessment, then we would catch it in the take-home or subsequent interviews. Moving someone forward is a **reversible decision** but rejecting someone is not.


>Reflecting on this now, this means that candidates that matched my biases would get the in-person explanation of the take-home and the ones that didn‚Äôt only got a written explanation. That reinforces bias. I‚Äôd do this differently next time to put everyone on the same footing.


# A humane take-home exercise is short and deserves feedback.

- Take-home exercise should take no longer than an in-person interview would take.
- Feedback with (5-10) bullet points about what I like or dislike or a mistake

### A good coding question relates to a real-world problem
- How to prepare good exercise:
	-   An existing coworker could solve it in the expected amount of time without any special prep. (Try it!)
	-   The problem is intellectually engaging, provoking curiosity.
	-   It combines more than one data structure or algorithm; neither should be esoteric.
	-   There is more than one valid way to solve it.
	-   There are edge cases or error handling to consider.
- So imagine a coding exercise like writing a ticket. Describe a problem with enough context that they can implement it. Maybe give them existing code to extend! Maybe leave some things out and see if they ask questions or make assumptions. See if they write tests. Or give them some code with a bug and some sample, buggy output and have them find and fix the problem.


### An onsite applies the same principles as the phone screen.

- This schedule has a balance between technical and non-technical interviews. 

**Sample onsite schedule**

1.  Coding exercise (2 hours) ‚Äì this is essentially a "double take-home", done onsite. Candidate is given a list of coding exercises similar to the take-home and has 2 hours to choose and complete 2 of the exercises.
    
    -   As with the take-home exercise, the candidate works on their own in a private room, with their own laptop, with access to the Internet, etc. I stay nearby to answer any questions that come up.
2.  Group code review (1 hour) ‚Äì The candidate presents their work from #1 to a group of 3-5 engineers, including the hiring manager and at least one other senior+ engineer.
    
    -   Candidates are expected to walk through their work and answer questions or respond to feedback that the reviewers have about it.
        
    -   In addition to assessing code, this also examines how the candidate communicates technical topics and how they react to criticism.
        
3.  Lunch (1 hour) ‚Äì The candidate eats lunch and socializes with a small group of engineers.
    
    -   Interviewers should balance between casually probing the candidate's experiences and selling the company.
        
    -   On the one hand, this is a mental break for the candidate. On the other, candidates sometimes let down their guard and we may see their more genuine self.
        
4.  Non-technical interview (1 hour) ‚Äì This is similar to the phone screen focusing on level 3 criteria. The interviewer should generally be at or above the seniority level of the candidate.
    
5.  Design interview (1 hour) ‚Äì For a senior+ candidate, they'll do a [system design](https://xdg.me/resources-for-system-design-interview-prep/) exercise. The interviewer should generally be at or above the seniority level of the candidate.
    
    -   The interviewer should prompt the candidate with a design question that will help assess factors in the [scorecard](https://xdg.me/interviewing-engineers/#the-success-of-a-hire-isnt-based-what-they-do-in-their-first-week-or-first-month) section on design interviews. It's helpful for calibration if interviewers use the same design question for all candidates, if possible.
        
    -   [Susan Fowler](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/10/7/the-architecture-interview) has a great write up on how to give these sorts of interviews.
        
6.  Executive interview (1 hour) ‚Äì At the time, my company had an executive above the level of the hiring manager participate and give a non-technical interview. If this wasn't mandatory, I would have added another non-technical interview with a team member or peer.
    
7.  Recruiter interview (1 hour) ‚Äì My company had the recruiter wrap up with a candidate at the end of the day. YMMV.


# Coach your interviewers on how to interview and give feedback.

I made a "Guide to interviewing for David's Team" that I shared with everyone. Here's an excerpt from it:

Before an Interview

-   DO review the scorecard and strategize how your questions will illuminate particular portions of it. Consider printing it out and bringing it with you for reference.
    
-   DO share your planned questions on the group slack channel.
    
-   DO review this document: it's a helpful refresher on things to keep in mind for each interview.
    

During an Interview

-   DO give the candidate an agenda for the time you'll be with them ‚Äì knowing what will happen sets candidates at ease.
    
    -   E.g. "So you know what to expect in this interview, first I'm going to tell you a bit about my role here, then I'm going to ask you some questions about your professional experiences, then we'll take some time working through a design exercise. At the end, I'll reserve some time for you to ask me some questions. Does that make sense?"
-   DO take notes. The means of doing this is up to the interviewer. The purpose of note-taking is to ensure that we accurately capture salient aspects of the candidate's response to questions.
    
-   DO sell the company: This is can be done implicitly by your interaction during the interview, but will likely be more explicit toward the end of the meeting - supported also by the candidate's questions.
    

After an Interview

-   DO provide detailed feedback on \[our interview website\] soon after your interview - while your memory is fresh.
    
    -   For scorecard elements: please add short comments to any item you rate to give context for the rating; don't rate things you didn't get signal on during the interview.
        
    -   For the summary: include observed pros/cons and any details about the interview that would be helpful in reaching a decision.
        
    -   Take a stand ‚Äì "No decision" means your interview failed to provide actionable insights and you should do a retrospective with the hiring manager or recruiter to see how you can improve your interviewing technique.
        
-   DO attend the debrief that is scheduled after all interviews are completed.
