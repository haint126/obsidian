# TLDR
- The classical triple constraint:
	- Cost = f(Scope, Time)
- The value triple constraint:
	- Value = f(Scope, Capability)
- The value triple constraint highlights:
	- Hidden costs from opportunity identification and decision making
	- Overall underlying processes
- Six Sigma Techniques are used to identify and eliminate defects

# Triple constraint

## The Classical Triple Constraint

- The classical triple constraint contains 3 factors:
	- Scope, Time, Cost
		- Cost = f(Scope, Time)
- Think of the Triple Constraint as the boundaries in which you can work.
- The Triple Constraint helps managers know what trade-offs are going to work and what impact they’ll have on other aspects of the project.
- Problem of classical triple constraint:
	- Time is a relative factor.
		- It has different impacts from project to project
	- Cost and time is not a good way to calculate business value


## The Value Triple Constraint

- The value triple constraint contains 3 factors:
	- Scope, Capability, Value
		- Value = f(Scope, Capability)

- The classical triple constraint leads to poor decision making by ignoring significant opportunity costs
- The Value Triple Constraint is a more universal model
	- (Value) It highlights hidden costs of opportunity identification and decision making
	- (Capability) It also highlights overall underlying processes, not just project controlling processes

### Value
- Value is the sum of:
	- Project Benefit (+)
	-  Identification Opportunity Cost (-)
	-  Decision Opportunity Cost (-)
	-  Project Schedule Cost (-)
	-  Project Delivery Cost (-)
- Example of value:
	- Major value elements:
		- Project benefit is 1.2mil/year
		- The opportunity is identified 2 years late
			- =%3E Identification opportunity cost = 2.4mil
		- It takes 6 month for the project to actually start
			- => Decision opportunity cost = 0.6mil
		- The project requires 18 months to deliver:
			- => Project schedule cost = 1.8mil
		- The actual spending on people and other resource is 2.4mil
			- => Project delivery cost = 2.4mil
	- The value is the sum of all of the above costs
	- Conclusion:
		- Benefit, Schedule Opportunity and Delivery costs are at the project level.
		- Identification and Decision Opportunity costs are at the higher management level, or Project Office level.
		- **The delay in identifying the opportunity is significant but is almost always a hidden cost**
		- **The time to decide to pursue the opportunity is also significant but ignored cost.**
- The Classical Triple Constraint strictly measures at the individual project level and does not work across projects
- The Value Triple Constraint model goes beyond the individual project
	-  For example, if we delay project A by one month in order to deliver project B one month earlier is that a wash?
	- **It allows us to focus our attention on where the true value (opportunity) lies**
	- It allows us to monitor and measure Value throughout the project rather than just budget and schedule changes
	- It help us pay attention to opportunity identification and decision making rather than solely to delivery benefits
	- It also allows us to measure hidden cost, how much value we have left behind
		- => Measure how capable the organization is at finding opportunities and acting on them.
	- It help managing conflicting demands by providing a project specific value which includes the total effects of cost, opportunity and schedule
		- => Only accepting changes if they raise the overall value
	- It allows us to identify high risk, low Value projects up front
	- This model forces the business to take responsibility for establishing and confirming the benefit

### Scope
The scope component does not change.

### Capability

- Capability refers to the capability of the underlying value-added processes used to deliver the project (or simply the value delivery process).
	- Reduce cycle time in underlying delivery process
	- Speed up decision making
	- Improve identification processes
	- ...
- There is not yet sufficient literature on the capability subject
- There are techniques for measuring capability such as six sigma.

#### Six Sigma Techniques

![[01_Experience/PMP/PMI/Develop project management skills/04_Technical Skills/14.1_Triple Constraint/Six Sigma techniques.png]]

- Processes that operate with "six sigma quality" on a "shift" of ± 1.5 sigma over the short term are assumed to produce long-term defect levels below 3.4 defects per million opportunities
- Goals are achieved through a two-pronged approach:
	- Identifying the problem
	- Solving the problem
- 5 Key Principles:
	- Focus on the Customer
	- Measure the Value Stream and Find Your Problem
	- Get Rid of the Junk
	- Keep the Ball Rolling
	- Ensure a Flexible and Responsive Ecosystem
- Six Sigma projects follow two project methodologies:
	- The DMAIC is used primarily for improving existing business processes (reduces/eliminates defects):
		- Define the system, the voice of the customer, and the project goals.
		- Measure key aspects and collect relevant data; calculate the "as-is" process capability
		- Analyze the data to investigate, verify cause and effect and seek out the root cause of the defect
		- Improve or optimize the current process
		- Control the future process to ensure that any deviations from the target are corrected before they result in defects.
	- The DMADV is typically used to create new processes and new products or services (prevents defects):
		- Define design goals that are consistent with customer demands and the enterprise strategy.
		- Measure and identify CTQs (characteristics that are Critical To Quality), measure product capabilities, production process capability, and measure risks.
		- Analyze to develop and design alternatives
		- Design an improved (~best) alternative
		- Verify the design, set up pilot runs, implement the production process and hand it over to the process owner(s).
- Six Sigma Techniques:
	- Brainstorming
	- Root Cause Analysis/The 5 Whys
	- Voice of the Customer
	- The 5S System => Removing waste and eliminating bottlenecks
	- Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)
	- Benchmarking
	- Poka-yoke (Mistake Proofing)
	- Value Stream Mapping
- Six Sigma Tools:
	- Cause and Effect Analysis
	- Flow Chart
	- Pareto Chart
	- Histogram
	- Check Sheet
	- Scatter Plot
	- Control Chart
