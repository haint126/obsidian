# Introduction

- This article addresses top project and requirements management challenges and seven keys to requirements management success.
- Requirements are a critical key to success for any projects
	- Most of the failures come from missing, misinterpreted, misunderstood, or mistaken requirements


# Top Project Challenges

- Top five project challenges (reasons for project failure) in priority order:
	1. Schedule, budget, and scope (requirements) are met fully but provide little business value
	2. Business/customers/users say they want an agile project but still want a fixed price
	3. Too many defects are found during user-acceptance testing, proving that requirements were not met, despite testing by the development/construction team
	4. Interfaces and integration with other systems or data currently in operation, or with other systems being developed by other projects, are unclear or undefined
	5.  Expectations of the business, customers, or users are too high

# Top Requirements Management Challenges

- Top five requirements management challenges in priority order:
	1. Time lag for various required approvals slows the project life cycle
	2. There are too many changes
	3. Business/customers/users expect budget to be static while scope increases
	4. Not doing proper 'scoping in and scoping out'
	5. Users/Customers not knowing what they want

# Critical Success Factors

- Top three critical success factors for managing requirements:
	1. Ensure the right stakeholders are involved in requirements definition
	2. Keep the requirements business-focused
	3. Manage the triple constraint - with the added dimension of "business value" (or just use the value triple constraint instead)

# Seven Keys to Requirements Management Success

1. Requirements must be managed to ensure true business value is achieved
	- We need to ensure the requirements traceability:
		- Requirements -> Project objectives -> Business objectives
		- The gathered requirement must be able to link back to the original project objectives, which in turn must support the business objectives
2. Involve the right people
	- Many challenges we faced come from wrong or missing stakeholders
	- For a smooth running of a project, we need to:
		- Identify stakeholders
		- Analyze them
		- Plan for communications with them
		- Manage ongoing expectations
	- Questions which may help to identify a strong core group of stakeholders:
		- Who are the business area subject matter experts?
		- Who will use the end product, service, or result of the project?
		- Who will pay for the work on the project?
		- Who understands the current environment, infrastructure, and architecture?
		- Who will be impacted by process improvement or automation?
		- Who else should be involved?
3. Have the right expectations
	- Be realistic about what can be delivered.
	- Hard truth, honest estimates, feasible deliverables, and realistic timeframes are all crucial to proper expectations.
4. Quality in requirements is as important or even more important than quality in the product
	- The focus on quality tends to diminish when the timeline is critical
	- Things to do to ensure requirement quality
		- Gather and document requirements
		- Validate that the right requirements are documented
		- Model use case, process and data
		- Verify quality using:
			- Desk checking
			- Walk throughs
			- Peer reviews
			- Inspections.
5. Consider the integration and interface points of other projects
	- Take a look at the project from a high-level view
		- Think outside the project
		- Consider all interfaces and possible integration points
6. Facilitate timely client approvals
	- Lack of timely approvals of requirements is always an issue
	- Some techniques to get timely approvals:
		- Plan for the sign off, make it a key milestone
		- Identify the signatory and communicate with them
7. Changes to requirements can completely alter the nature of a project
	- Any changes will affect project budget which will impact the delivery time
	- Requirements traceability (Key 1) will help managing changes and ensuring that it will align with business objectives
	- A strong change management will:
		- Mitigate the risk that changing requirements will not bring business value
		- Ensure the proper levels of requirements, authorities for sign off, communication, and documentation of the changes
		- Ensure all requisite stakeholders are involved
