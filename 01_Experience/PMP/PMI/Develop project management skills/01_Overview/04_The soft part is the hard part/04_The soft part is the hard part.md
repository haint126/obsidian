# TLDR

- Soft skills mastery:
	- Know the purposes of both sides
	- You cannot expect that other person to understand you if you do not understand them, their perspective, their purpose, their needs
	- The desire to understand derives from a genuine interest in that other person
	- Know which conventions are operating for you and for the other one, given each person's context.
	- Master the applicable convention, translate the conversation into a convention which you and the other person DO share
	- Organize your thinking before you start talking
	- Simplify your ideas
	- Listen. Listen empathically
	- Seek an appropriate level of precision in articulating your ideas.
	- Make use of other mechanisms besides your natural language
	- Ensure each person understand what the other has said
	- Ask questions to discover things that have been left unsaid that should have been said
	- Seek to meet that person’s needs by achieving your purpose


# Soft skills

- Soft skills aren't as much about knowledge as they are about behaviors and the application of those behaviors.

- **Soft skills definition: The ability to engage with and interact effectively with others.**

- Three powerful insights:
	- Engaging with and interacting effectively with others is exactly about managing relationships.
	- The only tool you have for managing relationships is communications.
	- Soft skills really do consist of only one foundational skill—communications. The only thing that changes is the purpose.


# Communications

- Mastery of soft skills = Mastery of communications =
	- Accepting complete responsibility for the success of each interaction
	- Conventions
	- Speaking
	- Thinking clearly
	- Feedback
	- Purpose

## Accepting complete responsibility for the success of each interaction
- Conversation is bilateral and bidirectional, both sides seek to be understood and to understand each other
- You cannot control the other person but you can influence them
- Each successful interaction influences other's action => Take responsible for the results of these changes

## Conventions
 - All communication presumes a convention, a protocol
	 - Meaning changes in different conventions
- Context influences which convention applies

- Steps to mastery (conventions):
	- Know which conventions are operating, given the context.
	- Master the applicable convention, translate the conversation into a convention which you and the other person DO share.

## Speaking
- A word might have different meaning to each person:
	- We have different experiences (different context) with the mentioned object
	- Words are ambiguous
	- Our word usages are imprecise
- Steps to mastery (speaking):
	- Seek an appropriate level of precision in articulating your ideas.
	- Seek to understand the other person’s context. Consider **how** they will understand your words and that it may be different from what you intend.
	- Make use of other mechanisms to enhance your use of language, such as photographs, drawings, sounds, and gestures.

## Thinking clearly
- You can't hope others to understand what you said if you do not understand it yourself

- Steps to mastery (thinking clearly):
	- Organize your thinking before you start talking. Using pencil and paper to capture words, sketches, diagrams, symbols, and other things.
	- Simplify your ideas.

## Feedback
- The communications process is complex and error prone
	- Words are ambiguous
	- We make a lot of assumptions about what we know and what the other person knows.
	- **People often hear only what they want to hear, or what they need to hear, rather than what we intend**

- Two techniques to verify understanding of what has been said:
	- If you are the listener, confirm your understanding by telling the other what you think you hear and ask them to verify
	- If you are the speaker, ask the other questions that get at their understanding and verify their thinking

- Steps to mastery (feedback):
	- Ensure you understand what the other person has said.
	- Ensure the other person understands what you have said.
	- Ensure you both get at what hasn't been said but should have been said.

## Purpose
- You need to be aware of and stay attuned to the purpose of each interaction
- Even more important than that is to know the other person’s purpose

- Steps to mastery (purpose)
	- Don't let your purpose or theirs remain implicit.
	- Ask why. Know why. Probe. Test. Discover. Clarify. Confirm.
	- Then consider the relationship between your purpose and theirs.
	- Look for ways to achieve your purpose by meeting the other person's needs.


# A simplified approach


- The skillful use of the question is one of the most valuable techniques to ensure understanding
- The best thing you can say is **saying nothing**
	- Allow other to talk
	- Allow you to listen
- Mastering soft skills = mastering relationships = making the other person focus on you = being genuinely interested in that other person, their purpose, and their needs
- Good communication <- Understanding <- Listening <- Empathy
- _**Soft skills are not about you!**_
	- Soft skills mastery means mastering the art of understanding the other person.

# Conclusion

	1. Know which conventions are operating, given the context.
