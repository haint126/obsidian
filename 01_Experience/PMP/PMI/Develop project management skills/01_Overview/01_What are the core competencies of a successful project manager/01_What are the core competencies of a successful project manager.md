- Five project "currencies":
	- A competent leader continually balances five project "currencies":
		- Time
		- Money
		- Knowledge
		- Security
		- Prestige
	- Most people can readily grasp the exchange rates for time, money, and knowledge.
	- Security and prestige are based on individual perception and thus are harder to quantify.
- For a project to be perceived as successful, all stakeholders have to feel that they received a positive exchange at the end of the project. 
	-  A competent project manager can present a stakeholder with a gain in one (or many) "currencies", and win their support for the project
