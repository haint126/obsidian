# What is Shared Vision?

- A vision is a positive mental image of the future
- Organizational visions = the visions of the leader of the organization
- A shared vision refers to an image that a group of people hold in common, an image of how the project will look, work, and be received by the customers when it is completed.
- A vision should contain enough information to motivate team members and provide direction for day-to-day work activity.
- Development of a shared vision is not a difficult process, but many project teams don't take the time to do it

# Developing a Shared Vision

## Before the first meeting:
- Each member of a project team know that they have been chosen for the project

## At the first meeting:
- PM should explain the assignment and the objectives of the organization in forming the project team
- PM should let the team members know that they will meet again in a few days to create a vision of the project
- PM should explain how the vision will be used and give examples of the effective use of vision on other project teams.

## At the shared vision meeting:
- This exercise will take approximately three to four hours
- Objective: Creating the shared vision of the project
	- Choose a comfortable location for the meeting. Keep the meeting informal. Make sure that the climate is safe, friendly, and cooperative.


### The first stage: _Mapping_
- Encourage team members to think broadly and to include all of the important aspects of the project in their image of the future
- Put the name of the project in the center and ask the team to list every aspect of the project that should be included in the vision
- The one leading this exercise should list some of the aspects in order for the ball rolling


### The second stage: _Would'nt it be great if ..._
- Generate a series of statements for each aspect of the project that begin with the phrase "Wouldn't it be great if…"
- You may need to give some examples so that the team understands what you expect.
- Encourage the team to forget about realistic barriers and limitations and to have fun with this activity.
- Don't allow anyone to begin throwing out comments like, "Get serious", or "It will never happen".

### Take a break

### The third stage: _Fine-tuning the vision_
- Ask the team to consider which of the statements should be adopted for the project.
	-  “It can never happen” is not a good reason to drop a statement
	- The statements that make up the core of the vision do not have to be determined by majority vote
	- A vision should be challenging as well as attainable.
- The statements that remain will make up the core of the vision. 
- When you complete this activity, you will have a list of 15 to 20 idealistic goals for the project.
- Some individuals will adopt one or more of the statements as their own (with or without group agreement) and drive the accomplishment of that goal.
	- If that goal is consistent with the shared vision, this behavior can add value to project outcomes.
		- A few of these leaders will emerge on each project team and take ownership of some of the more difficult aspects of the project.
		- Leaders serve as examples of what is possible and motivate the other team members.


### The fourth stage: _Put it together_
- Ask each team member to imagine what it would be like if they could make each of the goals a reality.
	- The reactions of their customers when they see the final product.
	- The project at completion.
	- How the team will feel, what they will see, what they will hear.


### After the shared vision meeting:
- The team will need another break in order to let the team members begin processing the vision and think about how they can achieve it
	- Ask people to think about how to accomplish each goal and come back the next day with some ideas about strategy.
	- Encourage the team members who want (and may need) to talk between the meetings and give them time to add things to the list at the beginning of the next meeting.


# Developing a Project Strategy

- Objective: developing a strategy to achieve the vision.
- Begin with a brief review of the articulated shared vision.
	- Taking one statement at a time
	- Ask the team to begin developing strategies to make the statement a reality
- It's important to encourage the team to develop specific strategies rather than changing the vision

- This process will take several hours if done by the entire team
- You may want to divide a large project group into smaller units to develop the specific strategies.
	- Assigning individual team members to be responsible for implementing each strategy.
- Put the vision, the strategies, and the name of the responsible team member in writing and make sure that everyone has a copy.
- The project leader should monitor each and all of the strategies.
	- If the project team is not using the strategies that will achieve the vision, the manager needs to take some action.

# Communicating the Shared Vision

- Copies of the vision statements should be given to team members, members of senior management of the organization, to customers, and to departments that will provide project support.
- The vision needs to be discussed, or at least referred to, in every meeting of the team.

## Vision as a Motivational Tool

- The vision can be used by the project leader and team members to motivate the team
	- It serves as a psychological contract between the organization, the team members, and the project manager.
- The team may need to be reminded that they are capable of achieving the vision if they use the strategies they developed.
- The vision also provides direction and clarifies the objectives.
	- It shows where the team is headed, and reminds them of what they agreed to do.
- A shared vision can also give the project team a competitive edge in a very competitive world.
