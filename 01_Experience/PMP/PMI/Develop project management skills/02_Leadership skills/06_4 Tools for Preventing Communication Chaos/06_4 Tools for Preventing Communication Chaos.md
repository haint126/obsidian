# TLDR

- Project communication covers a wide range of information sources and recipients => Error prone
- To avoid communication mistakes
	- Create communication plan:
		- Prioritize the necessary communication
	- Use elevator pitch:
		- Short summary of what the purpose of the project in 30s
	- Use storytelling:
		- Tell the purpose and goals of the project as a story
	-  Always communicate using the context and the information at the same time.
	- Use visualization to convey information quickly and clearly

# Project communication: a continuous chain

- Poor communication is often at the top of project failure statistics.
- Project communication covers a wide range of information sources and recipients
- Many project success factors depend on a good communication:
	- Maintain the momentum of change
	- Involve project stakeholders
	- Delegate tasks within the project team
	- Negotiate and resolve crisis situations and conflicts both within the team and among stakeholders.
	- Communication is part of the broader change management efforts that accompany project efforts.

# Where can a communication error happen?

- Communication errors can occur at any time:
	- Unclear project goals and benefits
	- Insufficient sharing of information within the team
	- Project reporting 
	- ...

# Avoiding communication mistakes

## 1. The communication plan

- Brainstorming to identify:
	- The target groups of communication
	- What we want to achieve through communication
	- What information we want to communicate
	- How often
	- The best format
	- Through which media
- We transform this analysis into a communication plan, available at the start of the project
- The communication plan tends to be very long => Cause a feeling of overload and stress
	- Prioritize the necessary communication
	- Do not prepare all the materials from the beginning
		- Create content for communication directly from the outputs of the project work as the project slowly progresses
		- Keep all the information available to a wider audience in one place

## 2. Storytelling and the elevator pitch

- Both of these techniques help us explain the goals and expected benefits in a clear and engaging way
- The elevator pitch:
	- Is a short summary of what the purpose of the project is and why we are implementing it.
	- The message should not take more than 30 seconds.
	- Only relay the most important information
	- Imagine communicate your intention with an important stakeholder in an elevator ride
- Storytelling:
	- Tell the purpose and goals of the project as a story to bypass the technical barrier
	- The story can play on emotions and create motivation to get people involved in the project
	- Describe what really happened so people can imagine better what you are trying to achieve

## 3. Context is key

- Always communicate using the context and the information at the same time.
	- When sharing the outputs of a project activity, show the link between this activity and the overall project roadmap
- Good techniques for dealing with the complexity of describing requirements for project outputs are:
	- The use of user stories
	- Results-driven development
	- Process-oriented descriptions of requirements for the functionality of information systems

## 4. Visualization

- Use visualization to convey information quickly and clearly
- Utilize visualization in project reporting
- Use burndown graphs to show how much work has already been done and how to approach the goal. 
- Use illustrative graphs and color coding to quickly direct the audience's attention.


# Summary
- Project communication involves a large number of people
	- => Erroneous information can quickly spread
- We must constantly pay attention to communication so that we:
	- Learn from mistakes
	- Verify that it's working properly
	- Adapt it to the goals we want to achieve.
- If there is a misunderstanding, immediately address any lapses in clarification and information.
