# TLDR

- 5 key components for people development:
	- Trust
	- **Loyalty**
	- Team performance
	- Opportunities
	- Growth and motivation
- Loyalty is not created by satisfying commitments but by repeatedly exceeding expectations
- Loyalty can bring much more benefits than ones think it can
- **Attitudes** drive behaviors
- **Connection between team member's need and the company's need** can drive motivations
- Project manager's **inspirations** can drive member's motivations
- Inspirations can come from simple actions but is usually neglected
- High levels of **team engagement** is important and can be created by continually reinforcing trust
- Asking **open-ended questions** can help project managers understand their members' thinking process
- Setting up **team norms** in all aspects can improve engagement and reduce conflicts



# Five key components for focused people development

![[01_Experience/PMP/PMI/Develop project management skills/03_Soft skills/09_Learn why managing people is just as important as managing the project/Five key components for focused people development.png]]

- Strategy vs tactic:
	- Strategy is a long-term goals and plans
	- Tactics are more concrete and smaller steps 
- Many focus on near-term values, tactics => Core skills (hard skills) are valued more
- Soft skills is more about strategy

## The Loyalty Factor – It's All about Trust

- Trust is often referred as one of the secret to good client and staff relationships
- The bond of trust leads to **loyal** relationships with stakeholders of all kinds
	- => Rewarded with gratitude, latitude and support.
- Similar to old management practices of short-term focus, we often direct our efforts toward stakeholder satisfaction rather than loyalty
	- Satisfaction = meeting the agreed commitments
	- Loyalty is built over time by repeatedly exceeding expectations
- Satisfaction is only the starting point, not the destination
- To achieve loyalty, you must meet your commitments and **consistently exceed expectations**.
- Stakeholders are willing to extend their trust in relationship with others they trust
	- => Referrals are an engine of growth.

- The "hard to measure" soft skills are highly correlated to employee loyalty resulting in customer (as well as all other stakeholders) loyalty
	- Soft skills -> Employee loyalty -> Stakeholder loyalty


## Performance-driven Advantage

- The primary predictive drivers for performance were dependent upon the organizational culture and the associated staff behavioral choices
	- Behaviors particularly key to organizational health include accountability, ownership, and transparent communication.
	- A desire to perform flawlessly AND evolve rapidly is critical to success.
	- High levels of "organizational health" lead to sustainable long-term results.

## Attitudes Create Opportunity

- Attitude is one of the most difficult problem because it drives both the good and bad behaviors


## Growth and Motivation

- Team members see the connection between their need and the company's need
	- -> They find personal motivation to change to match their growth with what the organization needs.
		- -> Benefits for both the members and the organization
- Technical team can often view their role in sales as negligible
	- With some understanding of the context of the sales process and decision process, they can be more successful in 'selling' to meet clients' needs



# What You Can Do: Maximizing Your Impact

- Chip Conley's model: A project manager who can provide X  can do Y
	- Money (Survival) -> Create base motivation
	- Recognition (Success) -> Create loyalty
	- Meaning (Transform) -> Create inspiration
	- ![[01_Experience/PMP/PMI/Develop project management skills/03_Soft skills/09_Learn why managing people is just as important as managing the project/Chip Conley's team member model.png]]
- Project manager's inspiration
	- -> Members' self motivation 
		- -> Commitment 
			- -> High-quality outcomes 
				- -> Benefits the team, client, and ultimately the organization
- Inspiration is difficult to acquire:
	- It is intensely personal, rarely repeatable and cannot be forced
	- It is based on alignment of values, attitudes, and choices made over time
	- Inspiration is acquired when we recognize and connect outcomes to something the team member values
- **Most managers only focus on the monetary needs while team members desperately seek personal inspiration.*
- **The one thing that means the most to many employees but often missing is appreciation for them and their work**.

## Team Engagement

- Achieving high levels of team engagement is a first priority for all project managers
- Team engagement starts with continually reinforced trust that then becomes: (requirements)
	- High levels of respect
	- Consistent culture
	- Behavioral predictability
	- Dependable outcomes.
- Engaged team members: (effects)
	- Volunteer solutions
	- Raise issues while they can still be resolved
	- Support each other regardless of who might be responsible.


- 12 statements for each team member to ensure that they feel ownership in the results and engage the process:
	1.  I know what is expected of me.
	2.  I have the materials and equipment I need.
	3.  I have opportunity to do what I do best every day.
	4.  In the last 7 days, I have received praise for good work.
	5.  My supervisor, or someone at work, seems to care about me as a person.
	6.  There is someone at work who encourages my development.
	7.  My opinions seem to count.
	8.  The mission or purpose of my company makes me feel my job is important.
	9.  Fellow employees are committed to quality work.
	10.  I have a best friend at work.
	11.  Someone has talked to me about my progress in last 6 months.
	12.  This last year, I have had opportunities to learn and grow.


## Listening

- A very difficult technique is **asking open-ended questions** as a habit:
	- The responses of those questions will expose team members' thought about asked matters
	- The leader is required to listen and structure response accordingly rather than prepare to be heard
	- The leader needs to use empathic responses and dialog starters to understand the members' viewpoints then replies appropriately
	- Example of open-ended questions:
		- What do you think about that?
		- What do you see?
		- How would you go about it?
- Another trick is to provide opportunities for open and constructive exchanges around improvements, opportunities, and changes.
	- Consider providing these opportunities at least quarterly
	- While brainstorming, all the ideas should be treated as equal and valid
	- The sorting process should occurs _after_ gathering all ideas so everyone can contribute more freely

## The Project Manager's Attitude Is Contagious

- Productive and positive team attitudes can motivate members to step beyond limitations while attitudes that drive undesirable behaviors can be very destructive
- Project managers who believe in the impossible often get the impossible as an outcome
- Understanding, communicating, and reinforcing the desirable attitudes for a productive team culture is crucial and should be treated as a team norm
- Project managers cannot expect team members to adhere to norms that they themselves are not willing to display or reinforce.

## Team Norms

- Some ideas of where agreement and reinforcement of team norms can really improve team engagement and individual motivation:
	- Work ethic:
		- What is a "standard work week"?
		- What is the expectation during "crunch times"?
		- Are there limitations on scheduling vacations?
	- Politeness:
		- The habitual use of "please," "thank you," and "how may I help you?" in dialog regardless of whether dealing with end-users, supervisors, or colleagues can set a tone of respect and address the need to feel valued.
		- What tone of voice, vocabulary, body language, and tone of terms are used regularly.
	- Communication:
		- The standards of speaking, reading, and writing in a businesslike way, the tone to use and when to use more formal forms 
	- Teamwork:
		- The receptiveness to get ideas from others, share responsibilities, take criticism, help others succeed, seek assistance, or step in to help resolve an issue.
	- Accountability:
		- Self-discipline and self-confidence to deliver on your commitments (what will be deliver, expected delivery time and quality)
		- Keep others informed with enough time that corrective measures can be put into place.
	- Failure:
		- Failures occur every day, particularly for teams that stretch limits.
		- Handling of failure as a learning experience encourages trying new things, while handling of failure through retribution stifles creativity and innovation.
	- Attitudes:
		- Reinforcing the "can do" attitude over the "can't do" attitude will celebrate success and learn from failures.

- Some key questions when assessing engagement on your teams:
	- What does healthy conflict look like? Where do we see well-reasoned differences of opinion? What do we do when we do not see them? (Absence of conflict is an indicator of low engagement.)
	- How do members hold their peers accountable? Are the attitudes you see related to accountability productive or destructive to team members?
	- How does the team regularly innovate and evaluate creative ideas as a team? Is time set aside to wrestle issues as a team? Do members have fun exploring new ideas or are they seen as an inconvenient change?
	- Does the decision-making process reflect the bigger picture—that is optimize against "the right answer" rather than what is best for individuals or sub-teams?
	- What is your role in demonstrating proficiency and mastery of soft skills? What soft skills do you think add the most value to your team to drive results?
