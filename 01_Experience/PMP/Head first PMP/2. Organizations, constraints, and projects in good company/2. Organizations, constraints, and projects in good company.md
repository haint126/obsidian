## [[#Project constraints|Project constraints]]
- 6 constraints: Time, scope, cost, quality, resource, risk
- Dealing with one of the constraints always has an effect on the others
- You always need to know how a change affects all of the constraints
- You need to make sure that changing project constraints is acceptable to your stakeholders

# Types of organizational structures

- The authority of project manager increase as the list goes down
- The project manager has the most authority and power in a project-oriented organization
- Read more on [[01_Experience/Glossary/Project expediter/Project expediter|project expediter]] and [[01_Experience/Glossary/Project coordinator/Project coordinator|project coordinator]]


## Organic
- You might see this structure in a very small company
- People have varied roles
- Project management is a part time responsibility for someone on the project team
- Project managers are usually contributors who take on the added responsibility of communicating with stakeholders
- Budget decisions are usually made by company owner


## Functional
- Authority is in the hand of functional managers
- Project team members always report to functional manager
- Project management decisions need to be cleared with functional managers.
- Project managers are the functional managers in getting the work done.
- Project managers spend a lot of time doing administrative tasks and only work as PMs a part of the time.
- You are likely to find project expediters in functional organizations


## Multidivisional
- Each division operates almost like its own company, having its own governance framework and management roles
- PMs might operate differently from division to division
- PMs are often project coordinators or part time expediters
- PMs are full-time contributors who take on the added responsibility of communicating project status
- Budget and resource allocation decisions are made by functional managers


## Matrix
- Responsibility and authority are shared between the functional managers and project managers

### Weak matrix
- PMs have some authority, but they aren't in charge of the resources on a project.
- Major decisions need the functional manager's cooperation or approval
- You can still find project expediters and project coordinators here

### Balanced matrix
- Project team members report to a project manager *and* a functional manager *equally*
- Project managers share authority with the functional managers.
- People-management decisions are made by the functional manager
- Project decisions are made by the project manager

### Strong matrix
- Project managers have more authority than functional managers, but the team still reports to both managers.
- The team might be judged based on both performance on projects, and functional expertise.
- However, delivery of the project is the most important.

## Project-oriented
- Authority is belonged to the PM
- Teams are organized around projects
- When a project is done, the team is released, and the team members move on to another project.
- All of the decisions about a project's budget, schedule, quality, and resources are made by project manager
- The PM is responsible for the success or failure of the project
- Project coordinators and expediters don't exist here


# Other dimension of organizational structures

## Virtual
- Virtual teams can be made up of people from different parts of the organization who might have different ways of working
- Project managers often take on the role of facilitating team communications
- PMs sometimes have authority over budget and resource allocation

## Hybrid
- Hybrid organizations work in both predictive lifecycles and adaptive lifecycles
- ==Predictive lifecycles tend to rely more on management for understanding scope and status, while adaptive ones make that data transparent and focus on self-management within each team ?????????????????==
- The way the project manager works varies from team to team

- A hybrid organization creates its own approach to doing work from multiple types of lifecycles
- Hybrid organizations use a mix of traditional and agile development techniques 
- For example, in hybrid organization, the teams:
	- Might use predictive processes identify scope and deadlines up front for projects
	- Then use incremental delivery goals in order to get fast feedback from customers on unfinished products

## Composite
- A composite organization uses many different types of organizational structures
- Composite organizations is a mix of functional and cross-functional project teams.
- For example, a company:
	- Mostly runs its projects in a functional way
	- Sometimes creates a project team where the project manager has authority

## Project management office
- Project managers have the most authority here of all these three types
- The PMO has almost total authority over all of the projects within an organization.
- The funding and workflow of projects is managed by the PMO
- Project managers prepare all data used to make decisions about projects
- Project managers make decisions about resource allocation


# Project constraints
- Every project is affected by 6 constraints:
	- Time
	- Scope
	- Cost
	- Quality
	- Resources
	- Risk
- Dealing with one of the constraints always has an effect on the others
- There is almost never an easy, obvious trade-off where you can sacrifice one to improve the others
- Any time your project changes, you will need to know how that change affects all of the constraints
- Whenever you are making a change that affects the project constraints, you need to be sure that the change is acceptable to your stakeholders

# Organizational process assets
- In an organization, all lessons from past projects are recorded in organizational process assets to share and help future teams

## Process
- The way your organization does its work

## Policies
- The rules your organization follows

## Procedures
- The practical guides that describe the steps each team will follow including:
	- Templates
	- Vendor/supplier lists
	- Change control guidance
	- Financial control guidance
	- Estimation methods

## Knowledge repositories
- The records of past projects and their lessons
- This is where the teams record their
	- Project metrics
	- Past schedules
	- Key takeaways
	- Financial data
	- Descriptions of configuration management
	- And other documentation


# Enterprise environmental factors

- These factors apply to all organizations of all sizes and types
- All enterprise environmental factors can have a big impact on how you manage your project
- Culture is one of the most important enterprise environmental factors
- Projects will often face external enterprise environmental factors, like compliance with government regulations


## People
- The skills and organizational culture where you work

## Market
- The way your company is performing in the market

## Risk tolerance
- Some companies are highly tolerant of risk and some are really risk-averse

## Standards
- Some companies depend on government standards to run their business and when they change, it can have a big impact

## Databases
- Where your company stores its data can make a big difference in the decisions you make on your project
