# Categorizing processes
- 49 Processes are organized in two ways
	- **Process groups**:
		- Divide by function
		- How you do the work
		- The actions you take on your project
	- **Knowledge areas**:
		- Divide by subject matter
		- What subject matter you are dealing with
		- The things you need to understand
- Every process is in exactly one process group and one knowledge area
- A knowledge area has lots of processes which can belong to several groups.


# Process groups

- All projects break down into process groups. 
- Process groups are like the steps you use when following a recipe.
	- **Needs**:
		- What you need, your stakeholders need
	- **Initiating** process group:
		- Researching and deciding what you’re going to build to fulfill the project's needs
		- Writing down the plan at a very high level
		- In a lot of companies, the project manager isn't even involved in much of this
	- **Planning** process group:
		- Going into detail:
			- What resources you already have and what are missing
			- Where to get missing resources
			- How much they will cost
		- Project manager is really in control and does most of the work comparing to Initiating
	- **Executing** + **Monitoring and Controlling** process group:
		- Executing process group:
			- This is where the bulk of the project work is done
		- Monitoring and Controlling process group:
			- Keeping an eye on everything that is happening
			- Adjusting processes as needed
	- **Closing** process group:
		- Closing out a project means making sure you get paid



# Project phases

- Big or complex or multi-stage projects need to be approach in phases:
	- Each phase includes all 5 process groups
	- The end of a phase is when you assess the finished work to hand it off to the the next phase
	- **Sequential phases** are phases that happen one after another and don't overlap (previous phase is 100% complete before next phase)
	- **Overlapping phases** is when the next phase starts before the previous phase ends
		- Each phase still needs to go through all 5 process groups
		- Overlapping phases can increase risk, because your team might have to do a lot of rework.
	- **Iterative phases** means executing one phase while planning the next
		- It is partway between sequential and overlapping
		- The team is performing the Initiating and Planning for next phase while also doing the Executing for the previous phase
		- After finishing Executing and Closing of the previous phase, the team can jump straight into the next phase's Executing
		- The whole team (including designers, testers, etc.) is usually working at the same time
		- This is a good way to deal with an uncertain, rapidly changing environment
		- Agile software development is based on the idea of iterative phases

# Anatomy of a process

- Every process has:
	- **Inputs**
		- Information used in project (including document templates, company's policies and rules)
	- **Tools and techniques**
