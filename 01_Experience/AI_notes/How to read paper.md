# Three-pass method

## Summary:

### The first pass: 5-10 mins
- Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.
- Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else.
- Read the conclusions.
- Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read.

### The second pass: < 1 hour
- Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper.
- Mark relevant unread references for further reading.

### The third pass: ~ 1 hour
- Identify and challenge every assumption in every statement. (Real)
- Think about how you would present a particular idea. (Virtual)
- Compare real vs virtual


## 1. The first pass

### Goal:
Get a bird's-eyes view of the paper => more passes or not

### Time:
5-10 minutes.

### Steps:
- Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.
- Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else.
- Read the conclusions.
- Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read.

### Questions:
- Category:
	- What type of paper is this?
	- A measurement paper?
	- An analysis of an existing system?
	- A description of a research prototype?
- Context:
	- Which other papers is it related to?
	- Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
- Correctness:
	- Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
- Contributions:
	- What are the paperâ€™s main contributions?
- Clarity:
	- Is the paper well written?


## 2. The second pass

### Goal: 
- Jot down the key points.
- Make comments in the margins.

### Time:
Up to 1 hour

### Steps:
- Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper.
	- Pay special attention to graphs. Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant? Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.
- Mark relevant unread references for further reading.
	- This is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper.


## 3. The third pass

### Goal:
Virtually re-implement the paper: making the same assumptions as the authors to re-create the work.
=> Reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory.
=> Identify innovations, hidden failings and assumptions.
=> Ideas for future work.

### Time:
- 1 hour for experts
- 4-5 hours for beginners

### Steps:
- Identify and challenge every assumption in every statement. (Real)
- Think about how you would present a particular idea. (Virtual)
- Compare real vs virtual


# Additional question:
1. What previous research and ideas were cited that this paper is building off of? (this info tends to live in the introduction)
2. Was there reasoning for performing this research, if so what was it? (introduction section)
3. Clearly list out the objectives of the study
4. Was any equipment/software used? (methods section)
5. What variables were measured during experimentation? (methods)
6. Were any statistical tests used? What were their results? (methods/results section)
7. What are the main findings? (results section)
8. How do these results fit into the context of other research and their 'field'? (discussion section)
9. Explain each figure and discuss their significance.
10. Can the results be reproduced and is there any code available?
11. Name the authors, year, and title of the paper!
12. Are any of the authors familiar, do you know their previous work? 
13. What key terms and concepts do I not know and need to look up in a dictionary, textbook, or ask someone?
14. What are your thoughts on the results? Do they seem valid?
