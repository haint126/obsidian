- Limiting the choice of architecture and spend more time on data
	- Always start (or stick) with ResNet50.
	- Try EfficientNet for speed and efficiency
	- Try MobileNetV3 or V2 for mobile friendly architecture
- Good data is immensely helpful than good architecture
- The choice of optimizer and activation function can also impact the results
	- Always start with Adam optimizer and ReLU activation
