# GAN only generates a specific subset of the data
- Situation:
	- Use GAN to generate more data
	- Balance dataset
	- Both loss functions converged nicely
	- However, GAN only generates a specific subset of the data
- Problem:
	- The discriminator network is stuck in a local minimum allowing the generator to cheat.
