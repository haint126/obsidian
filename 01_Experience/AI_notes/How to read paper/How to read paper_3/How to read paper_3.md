# 4 passes
- Andrew Ng recommends readers go over a paper 4 times.
- In each pass, you incrementally absorb the paper.
- The goal is to understand papers by getting the following information, in order:
	1. Context
	2. Motivation and results
	3. Implementation
	4. Nitty-gritty details

# 1st pass: title, abstract, and pictures
- *Some papers (esp. DL) are almost completely explained in one of the figures*

- The goal: To be able to quickly gather a fairly uneducated "elevator pitch" for the paper 
	- => Have good context on what it talks about.


# 2nd pass: intro, conclusions, skim the rest
- The *intro/conclusion* are usually where the authors try to convince reviewers that their paper is important, so they take a lot of care to make it a good summary
	- Now, you should know:
		- Why they wrote it
		- What they accomplished

- At this point, you can skip/skim the related work section.
	- If you're new to the paper's field, it's going to be tough to understand.
	- Sometimes, it's also where authors try to promote the work of their colleagues or promote the work of a potential reviewer to get brownie points.

# 3rd pass: the whole thing, but skip/skim math

- Now that you have all the context you need, it's time to see how the authors actually did it.
- However, it's really easy to get bogged down in the specifics of the math. Try to focus on *building a conceptual map* of the paper here.


# 4th pass: the whole thing, but skip what doesn't make sense

- Now it's time to go back over the paper to reinforce what you gathered in the previous pass.
- You also are better equipped with the context to understand the specifics of the math.


# Why skip what you don't get?

- Research is at the cutting edge of the field
	- => Nobody fully understands the content, not even the authors.
- Sometimes older papers reference archaic topics that are no longer discussed
	- => They aren't relevant.
