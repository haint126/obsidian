- Recap:
	- *Machine learning* identifies patterns using statistical learning and computers by unearthing boundaries in data sets. You can use it to make predictions.
	- One method for making predictions is called a *decision trees*, which uses a series of if-then statements to identify boundaries and define patterns in the data.
	- *Overfitting* happens when some boundaries are based on on distinctions that don't make a difference. You can see if a model overfits by having test data flow through the model.


# Model Tuning and the Bias-Variance Tradeoff

- Recap:
	- Models approximate real-life situations using *limited data*.
	- In doing so, errors can arise due to assumptions that are overly simple (*bias*) or overly complex (*variance*).
	- Building models is about making sure there's a *balance* between the two.
