# Metrics
## Accuracy
- Accuracy is not a good metric when you face a very imbalanced problem


## Recall
- Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

## Micro-average F1-Score
- Micro-average F1-Score calculates the proportion of correctly classified samples out of all instances, the same as the model's accuracy definition


## Macro-average F1-Score
- Macro-average F1-Score penalizes the model equally for any class that doesn't perform well, regardless of its importance or how many support samples it has
- -> Use for heavily imbalanced dataset


## The Weighted F1-Score
- The Weighted F1-Score scales the individual F1-Score of each class. This method favors the majority classes
