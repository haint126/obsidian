# TLDR
- When you hear "latent," think of "compressed."
- "Latent space" is where we represent "latent data."
- We can measure distance in latent space and use it to determine how similar two points are.

# Latent
- We usually use the word “Latent” to refer to the compressed representation of data.
	- Yes, there is latent data that is not compressed at all
- The encoder creates the latent representation from the input while the decoder reverses the process.

# Latent space
- When we talk about "latent space," we refer to the space where the compressed representation of the data lives.
