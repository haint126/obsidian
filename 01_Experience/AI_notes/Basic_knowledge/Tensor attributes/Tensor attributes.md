# Tensor attributes
- 3 primary attributes that define a tensor:
	1. It's rank: (number of axes)
	2. It's shape: (number of dimensions per axis)
	3. It's data type: (type of data contained in it)

- Example:
	- A 5 row, 4 column matrix:
		- Rank is 2
		- Axes are dimension 5 and 4 => shape is (5,4)
	- The scalar (real number) 3.2
		- Rank is 0
		- Shape is ()


## Rank
- The rank of a tensor refers to the tensor's number of axes.
	- Examples:
		- Rank of a matrix is 2
		- Rank of a vector is 1
		- Rank of a scalar is 0


## Shape
- The shape of a tensor describes the number of dimensions along each axis (number of values in each axis)
	- Examples:
		- () scalar
		- (2,) vector 
		- (3, 2) matrix
		- (3, 2, 5) 3D tensor


## Data type
- The data type of a tensor refers to the type of data contained in it.
	- Examples:
		- float32
		- float64
		- uint8
		- int64
