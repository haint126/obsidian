# Curse of Dimensionality
- Curse of Dimensionality: Data dimensions **⬆** => Computational efforts **⬆⬆⬆**
	- Curse of Dimensionality describes the explosive nature of increasing data dimensions and its resulting exponential increase in computational efforts required for its processing and/or analysis.

- Data dimensions **⬆** => Data information (quality) **⬆** + Noise **⬆** + Redundancy **⬆**
	- An increase in the dimensions can in theory, adds more information to the data thereby improving the quality of data but practically increases the noise and redundancy during its analysis.
