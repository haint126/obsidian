# Data analysis
- Define which data is required
	- Analyzing the data is not part of a data pipeline. During the data analysis phase, the team will define the data required by the system. This is a manual step that happens before the data pipeline is ready. During the data analysis phase, the team will make the necessary decisions to build the data pipeline. Therefore, the first option is incorrect.


# Data pipeline
- A data pipeline is a fully automated process. There shouldn't be any steps that require human intervention.


## Data ingestion
- Store data in one location
	- Data ingestion is one of the steps of a data pipeline. During this step, we ingest the data from the different data sources and transfer it to where we will store it and later process it. For example, the company may need data currently stored in spreadsheets, databases, and a few real-time sensors. The data ingestion step will get the necessary data from each place and keep them in the final location for the rest of the process.


## Data preparation
- Standardize data format
	- Data preparation is another essential step of a data pipeline, where we format and prepare the data before using it. For example, the company might want to standardize the format of dates collected from different sources or perform specific transformations on numerical data.


## Data validation
- Check if needed data is present and follow appropriate schema
	- Data validation is another step of a data pipeline. We can validate that the necessary data we are ingesting is present and follow the appropriate schema during this step. For example, we might need to collect a minimum number of samples daily and raise an exception during the data validation step if we don't meet that condition.
