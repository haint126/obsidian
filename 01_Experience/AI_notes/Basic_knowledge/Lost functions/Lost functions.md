# Loss function based on dataset imbalance
- Here is a quick list of function losses depending on the dataset:
	- Balanced dataset: Binary Cross-entropy
	- Mildly imbalanced: Dice Loss
	- Highly imbalanced dataset: Focal loss and Focal Tversky Loss

# Loss function based on multi-label/multi-class

- Binary cross-entropy is the loss function used for multi-label classification problems.
- Categorical cross-entropy is the loss function used for multi-class classification problems.
