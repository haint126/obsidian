# Relationship between number of features and dataset size

- Imagine graphing a set of numbers.
- Since you have only one dimension, they will all lie somewhere in a line.
- Increase the features by adding a second dimension
	- => Now your values became a set of 2D coordinates (x, y)
	- If you graph them, they will all be somewhere in a plane.
- => As we increase the dimensionality of the data, it will be harder and harder to fill up the space with the same number of points.
- => This increase in sparsity will make it much harder for the learning algorithm to find any interesting patterns.
- => The more features we add, the more samples we need


## TLDR

- More features ~ Better representation
- More features => More dimensions => Increase sparsity => Need more data to find patterns
