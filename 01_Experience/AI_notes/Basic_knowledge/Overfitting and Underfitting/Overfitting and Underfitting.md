# Overfitting

- The model is too complex for your dataset
- The model captures the noise of the data because it fits the data too well
- The model's performance is high on the training but very low on the validation data
- High variance

# Underfitting

- The model is too simple for your dataset
- The model can't capture the underlying trend of the data because it can't fit the data well enough
- The model's performance on the training and validation data is very low
- High bias
