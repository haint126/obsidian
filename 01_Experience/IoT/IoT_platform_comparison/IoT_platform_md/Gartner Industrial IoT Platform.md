# Overview

## What is industrial IoT platform
- Gartner defines the market for industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platforms as a set of integrated software capabilities to improve:
	- Asset management decision making
	- Operational visibility and control for plants, depots, infrastructure and equipment
- An IIoT platform may be consumed as
	- A technology suite
	- Or an open and general-purpose application platform
	- Or both in combination.
- The platform is engineered to support the requirements of safety, security and mission criticality associated with industrial assets and their operating environments.
- The IIoT platform software that resides on devices such as controllers, routers, access points, gateways and edge computing systems is considered a part of a distributed IIoT platform.

## IIoT platform vs IoT platform
> This part is not directly from Gartner
=> IIoT platform Can do things like a general IoT platform but much more robustly
=> IIoT platform also focus more on industrial concerns: safety, security, mission-criticality.
=> IIoT solutions are device-light but data-heavy.

- An IIoT platform essentially covers a similar array of capabilities as the generalized IoT platform but is optimized for industrial IoT cases and the requirements associated with industrial settings.
- What really differentiates the IIoT platform from the generalized IoT platform is the scope of the offering, the specific industry focus, and the emphasis on industry-level security standards.
- In this sense, IIoT platforms need to be especially robust. They are expected to:
	- Maintain thousands of connected IoT devices
	- Scale up and down quickly
	- Ensure seamless data flow at all times
	- Manage massive volumes of IoT data.
	- Flexible enough to connect with machines and equipment from many different vendors
	- Support the development of logic/smart algorithms on IoT devices
- IIoT platforms address three concerns in the world of industrial IoT:
	- Safety
	- Security
	- Mission-criticality
- An end-to-end IoT platform that covers the full IoT development cycle will typically include the following: 
	- IoT device management;
	- Data collection capabilities;
	- IoT data modeling, analytics, visualization;
	- App development capabilities / a marketplace for IoT apps;
	- IoT collaboration enablement / social features.
- The end-to-end IIoT platform would have the following:
	- IIoT device management;
	- **Machine-to-machine communication (M2M);**
	- Data collection capabilities;
	- IIoT data modeling, advanced analytics, data visualization;
	- **Industrial security standards;**
	- App development support;
	- IoT collaboration enablement / social features.

## IIoT platform vs MES
> This part is not directly from Gartner
=>IIoT platform is decentralized and open platform compared to centralized and vendor lock-in MES
=> There is no clear winner between MES and IIoT platform, the best approach might be combining the best of both.

- For the past 30 years, MES, or manufacturing execution systems, have been the traditional way to streamline operations all the way down to the shop floor. They manage industrial assets, collect data, and ensure traceability in an industrial setting, among others.
- IIoT platform vs MES:
	- Centralized vs. decentralized:
		- As a more traditional approach to IIoT, MES are centralized solutions.
		- IIoT platforms are more flexible as they tend to be microservice-based and decentralized. On top of that, some IIoT platforms come with advanced analytics capabilities as well as support for IoT app development.
	- Vendor lock-in vs. open platform:
		- MES tend to be vendor-specific and proprietary so industrial manufacturers can only work with their vendor’s modules. And you can buy the vendor’s apps only. The manufacturers have little control over the applications they develop and deploy.
		- IIoT platforms come with apps as a service and perform most of the work an MES does. They can also expand the MES array of use cases.
- MES or IIoT platform
	- MES are still widely used in Industry 4.0 settings.
	- Some people value one above the other.
	- [IIoT platforms can be used as a supplement](https://tulip.co/blog/mes/mes-or-iiot-platform-or-both-which-is-right-for-me/) to get the maximum value out of an existing MES solution.
	- As a [recent publication](https://www.machinemetrics.com/blog/mes-vs-iiot-platform) says, a best-of-both-worlds approach may yield the best results: “integrating an IIoT platform to maximize the returns from your MES investments is the logical decision”.

## Magic Quadrants
- Magic Quadrants are forward-looking, to help clients identify vendors likely to keep up with or even stay ahead of the overall market.
- **Our analysts look broadly at customer feedback across markets, as well as a company’s forward-looking strategy, roadmap and capabilities**.
- Peer reviews are driven solely by reviewers’ organizations’ specific experiences relative to their unique needs.
- Hence, there may be a difference in analyst opinions about vendors, products and services versus user sentiment as expressed in peer reviews.
- Vendors from other quadrants may be a better fit as they may offer better products, better address requirements from particular verticals and/or be more affordable.

## Critical Capabilities
- Critical Capabilities documents provide **insight into how well a product or service fulfills certain functional capabilities within specific use cases**.
- Critical Capabilities reports are a point-in-time analysis to address the question of which vendor will have the best product given your weighting of which capabilities are most important to your organization.

## Gartner Peer Insights
- In addition to the synthesis provided by the Customers’ Choice, the individual reviews and ratings within Gartner Peer Insights can be **a valuable source of lessons learned for those currently in the buying cycle for the IIoT platform market**, particularly if you can find and read reviews from end users like you (for example, those that share your technology adoption bias, company size, industry or geography).
- These reviews give insight into not only how satisfied existing customers are with a vendor’s product, but also their experience in negotiating with the vendor, getting support for the product or service and their overall implementation effort. This information can provide you with a firsthand view on what to expect from a particular vendor

# Critical Capabilities
- The top two factors that drove customers’ choice of IIoT platform vendor are:
	- Technical expertise to develop solutions
	- The strength of the platform/technology suite.

## Critical Capabilities Definition
- Device Management
	- Software that enables manual and automated tasks to create, provision, configure, troubleshoot and manage fleets of IoT devices and gateways remotely, in bulk or individually, and securely as required by industry standards and regulatory mandates.
- Integration
	- Software, tools and technologies, including communications protocols, APIs and application adapters, that minimally address the data, process, enterprise application and IIoT ecosystem integration requirements across cloud and on-premises implementations for end-to-end IIoT solutions.
	- These solutions include IIoT devices, IIoT gateways, IIoT edge and IIoT platforms.
- Data Management
	- Software that addresses competencies from data ingestion (e.g., streaming) and persistence (e.g., data lakes) to organization (e.g., ontologies) and governance (e.g., data obsolescence).
	- IoT projects add additional complications, such as scalability (for massive volumes of IoT sensor data), latency (for real-time response), distribution (across the IoT edge, IoT core and applications) and governance (i.e., who has rights to IoT data).
- Analytics
	- Processing of data streams, such as device, enterprise and contextual data, to provide insights into asset state by monitoring use, providing indicators, tracking patterns and optimizing asset use.
	- A variety of techniques, such as rule engines, event stream processing, data visualization and machine learning, may be applied.
- App Enablement and Management
	- Software that enables business applications in any deployment model to analyze data and accomplish IoT-related business functions, such as executing workflow to choreograph whatever action is desired based on the changing conditions of monitored assets.
	- Core software components manage the OS and standard input/output or file systems to enable other software components of the platform. The application platform (e.g., aPaaS) includes application enabling infrastructure components, application development, runtime management and digital twins. The applications developed using App Enablement and Management are often one or more digital twins — see “Use 4 Building Blocks for Successful Digital Twin Design.”
- Security
	- Software, tools and practices facilitated to audit and ensure compliance, and to establish and execute preventive, detective and corrective controls and actions to ensure the privacy and security of data across the IIoT solution.
- Ease of Implementation and Use
	- Involves the number of resources and the skills needed for an IIoT platform’s implementation, operation and overall time to value.
	- It includes the ease with which developers navigate and perform tasks, and the prebuilt libraries of the vendor (or vendor partners). Ease of use and implementation is a critical design consideration and differentiator. This includes the ease to design, develop and use a digital twin; the IIoT platform’s ability to integrate discrete digital twins into a composite asset digital twin; and the portfolio or library of digital twins that the vendor has developed.
- Deployment Options
	- Involves the ability to deploy the full IIoT Platform on the edge, the cloud or a hybrid mix of the two, to optimize where the data is processed.
	- The complexity of industrial assets and the business requirements plus the mix of data dictate that end users have the flexibility to determine where they will process the data. In some cases, there will be latency, compliance or cost issues that fundamentally require an edge deployment. In other cases, the enterprise may need more contextual data and lower cost and more scalable compute capabilities that are cloud-native.

## Critical Capabilities Use-Case Graphics
- This analysis evaluates vendor effectiveness in supporting enterprise needs in four use cases: condition monitoring, predictive analytics for equipment, connected industrial assets and intermittently connected asset
	- Condition Monitoring
		- Ability to monitor the condition of complex industrial assets and data systems
		- This includes the management of the asset's and the gateway's software
	- Connected Industrial Assets
		- Ability to employ subsystems, modules and components using embedded technologies to produce significant volumes of data.
		- The enterprise also needs ensures asset activities are managed, operating systems and applications are patched and updated, data is secure, and standardized methods connect components into the asset.
		- Both integration approaches and digital twin management are required.
	- Predictive Analytics for Equipment
		- Ability to identify the condition of the assets, analyze anomalies, and forecast and inform scheduling systems of the right maintenance routine to restore and optimize asset operation.
		- => Improve maintenance and inspection scheduling, improve planning, extend asset lifetime, and minimize unplanned downtime.
	- Intermittently Connected Asset
		- Ability to deploy a full IoT platform on the edge
		- => Process data physically close to the assets and independent of the cloud
