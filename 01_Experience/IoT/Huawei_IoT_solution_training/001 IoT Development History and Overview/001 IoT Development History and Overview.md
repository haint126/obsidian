# TLDR:

- An IoT system contains 4 layers:
	- Application
	- Platform
	- Network
	- Sensing

# Preface
Starting page: 1
-  IoT is an Internet where all things are interconnected:
	- The core and foundation of the IoT is still the Internet.
	- The IoT connects any object at the user end for information exchange and communications.
