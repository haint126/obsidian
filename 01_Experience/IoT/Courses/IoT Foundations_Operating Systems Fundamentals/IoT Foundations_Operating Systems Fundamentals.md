# Outlines
- These key topics include
	- Task management
	- Inter-task communication
	- A synchronization
	- Memory allocation
	- Timers
	- Interrupts
	- Some debugging tools.

# OS characteristics
- An OS helps managing tasks and resources, providing interfaces
- OS characteristics:
	- Tanks and resource management
	- Portability, modularity
		- Support many types of software and hardware
	- Extensibility for network connectivity options
		- Support multiple network connectivity options
	- Power efficient, power management and footprint
		- Low power, small size and memory
	- Extensibility
		- Security and stability
	- Modularity, toolchain, support and licensing
		- Ease product development

## Resource and power management
- Efficient resource usage
- Manage power for power conversion

## Footprint
- Memory and storage requirement for OS
- OS should have small footprint
- OS should be configurable for adding features

## Extensibility and modularity
- Extensibility means an OS is extensible for adding features and using some third party software frameworks or libraries.
- Modularity means an OS supports a modular architecture

## Portability
- An OS should be portable to use a range of processors, hardware platforms, and IO devices.

## Toolchain and support
- Support for compiler and debugger tools
- Support from the vendor and the user community

## Licensing
- Open source licences
- Permissive licenses
	- MIT license
	- Apache License 2.0
	- BSD licenses.
- Copyleft licenses
	- GNU LGPL license
- Commercial license

# General-purpose OS vs Embedded OS
- General-purpose OS
	- Rich functionalities
	- Complex software
	- Powerful processors
	- High-capacity memories
- Embedded OS
	- Efficient resource management
	- Reliability
	- low to high-end processors
	- Simple or complex software

# Some open-source embedded OS
- FreeRTOS
	- Market-leading RTOS
	- Small footprint (10KB memory) and easy-to-use API
	- Highly portable with broad support for processor architectures
	- Flexible scheduling and memory management options
	- Extensible
- Mbed OS
- Nynewt OS
- Zephyr
- RIOT
- Contiki OS
- TinyOIS

# Embedded Linux
- uCLinux
- Yocto Project
- OpenWrt
- Android Things

# Windows 10 IoT Cores

# Task scheduling

# Memory allocation
