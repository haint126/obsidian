# IoT maturity model in enterprises

- IoT maturity depends on 2 objectives -> 2 different maturity types:
	- Internal and operational improvements
	- External and products/customers

# Gartner’s Maturity Model for IoT

- 3 IoT maturity model dimensions: ![[01_Experience/IoT/IoT_maturity/IoT_maturity_model/IoT maturity model dimensions.png]]
	- **Business** — Linking IoT adoption and integration with business and financial performance
		- **Economic model** — Relationship to business models and business outcomes, ranging from incremental benefits to digital business transformation
		- **Business Alignment** — Executive- and board-level awareness and support, value-capture mechanisms, metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs)
		- **Ecosystem** — The level of IoT engagement in digital business initiatives to drive differentiation in an ecosystem (the ecosystem is composed of suppliers, partner enterprises, competitors and other stakeholders such as regulators, finance and insurance firms) or to establish an ecosystem platform
	- **Organization** — Having the right skills and aligning with how IoT is used
		- **Business Processes** — Business processes and workflows to leverage capabilities and capture benefits
		- **Culture** — Staffing and expertise, behavior, and leadership and organization unit alignment and accountability
		- **Data and Information Governance** — Policies and procedures for data collection, curation, usage (especially sharing), digital ethics, privacy and security
	- **Technology** — Architecting, building or procuring the sensors, security, networking,infrastructure and analytics, as well as IT and OT alignment
		-  **Architecture** — Structure, framework, and processes to deploy and manage IoT solutions
