# Behavior

## Transition time 
- moveToLevelWithOnOff can turn on the bulb (change onOff from 'off' to 'on')
- On/Off with transition time
	- true:
		- Use `globalStore` to save brightness level before turning off
		- On -> Off:
			- Use moveToLevelWithOnOff and save previous brightness to globalStore
		- Off -> On:
			- Use moveToLevelWithOnOff and set brightness to previous value
	- false: Change OnOff attribute of cluster genOnOff normally
		- On -> Off:
			- Save previous brightness to globalStore in case of turning On with transition time
			- Change OnOff attribute of cluster genOnOff normally
		- Off -> On: 
			- If previously turning off with transition time:
				- Use moveToLevelWithOnOff and set brightness to previous value
			- else
				- Change OnOff attribute of cluster genOnOff normally
- Change brightness with transition time:
	- Initially transition_time is set to 0
	- When sending command, transition time = transition_time


## Color_temp
- Using Move to Color Temperature Command will set
	- ColorMode to 0x02


## Color
### ColorMode and EnhancedColorMode
- ColorMode:
| Attribute Value | Color                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 0x00            | CurrentHue and CurrentSaturation |
| 0x01            | CurrentX and CurrentY            |
| 0x02            | ColorTemperatureMireds           |

- EnhancedColorMode:
| Attribute Value | Color                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0x00            | CurrentHue and CurrentSaturation         |
| 0x01            | CurrentX and CurrentY                    |
| 0x02            | ColorTemperatureMireds                   |
| 0x03            | EnhancedCurrentHue and CurrentSaturation |

=> Does not seem to be useful except when differentiate using CurrentHue and EnhancedCurrentHue

### Hue and Saturation
- Using Move to Hue and Saturation Command will set
	- ColorMode to 0x00
- Using Enhanced Move to Hue and Saturation Command will set
	- ColorMode to 0x00
	- EnhancedColorMode to 0x03

- hue = trueHue x 254 / 360
- EHue = trueHue x 65535 / 360
- saturation = trueSaturation x 254 / 100

### CurrentX and CurrentY
- Using Move to Color Command will set
	- ColorMode to 0x01
- Using color space xyY

## options.color_sync()
- options.color_sync() does not seem to do anything


## Color Loop
- If color loop is active, he device SHALL immediately react on updates of the ColorLoopDirection and ColorLoopTime attributes

- Action:
| Value | Description                                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0x00  | De-activate the color loop.                                                    |
| 0x01  | Activate the color loop from the value in the ColorLoopStartEnhancedHue field. |
| 0x02  | Activate the color loop from the value of the EnhancedCurrentHue attribute.    |

- Direction:

| Value | Description                          |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| 0x00  | Decrement the hue in the color loop. |
| 0x01  | Increment the hue in the color loop. |
- Time: in seconds

- updateFlags:

| Bits: 0       | 1                | 2           | 3                |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Update Action | Update Direction | Update Time | Update Start Hue |
