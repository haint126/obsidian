# What is IoT platform

## What is a platform
A platform is a group of technologies that are used as a base upon which other applications, processes or technologies are developed.


## Why IoT platform

- The Internet of Things (IoT) can't function without software, including middleware
- IoT platform is a middleware which sits between IoT devices + IoT gateways (the data) and applications
- IoT platform enables:
	- IoT device and endpoint management
	- Connectivity and network management
	- Data management (acquisition + storage)
	- Processing and analysis
	- Application development
	- Security
	- Access control
	- Monitoring
	- Event processing
	- Interfacing/Integration
- In reality, each IoT application and solution come with different 
	- Architectures
	- Ways of connecting and managing devices
	- Possibilities to manage and analyze data
	- Capabilities to build applications
	- Options to leverage IoT in a meaningful way
---
- There is a list of benefits for any company to adopt an IoT platform, and help them focus on their business instead of on the Internet of Things technologies.
	 - Single point for adapting protocols and data models for gathering the information and managing the communications
	-  Easiness for adding new business applications through common interfaces
	-  Creates common best-practices for IoT solutions, specially in defining protocols and deployment processes
	-  Scale connectivity and data floods separately from the rest of the organization, allowing for the other application to keep running
	-  Adapt to existing workflows through state-of-the-art integration mechanisms
	-  Unify Device Management capabilities, simplifying corporate management
	-  Separate raw data from business data, dedicating a BigData common for all the businesses
	-  Add common IoT functionalities, like threshold detection, to all applications, implementing only once
	-  Secures connectivity with devices in a separate layer, simplifying
	-  Centralises and reduces the knowledge and task force required to operate and maintain device and connectivity issues
---
- A robust strategy needs to cover these three areas:
	- Desirability (does the market want your product?)
	- Viability (is there a business model where you can make money with your product?)
	- Feasibility (can you build your product?)

1. It helps you validate your business case early
2. It helps you go to market quickly
3. It may include ready-made software, tools, materials that you can use
4. It lets you avoid rabbit holes: security, certifications, compliance
	1. IoT platform vendors have expertize in this area that allow them to be up-to-date on security.
5. It provides features that could be essential for your project
	-   **Low-power operation**. Some IoT systems require battery-operated devices. Batteries require special mechanism to ensure an extremely low power consumption, and this is supported by some IoT platforms.
	-   **Long-range, unattended networking**. Large-scale IoT systems often require the connectivity to work even if the devices are far away from their users. Some IoT platforms specifically support such use cases.
	-   **Ease of installation**. For many IoT systems, installation is the activity that requires the most personnel. Having a good installation process therefore quickly pays off. Many IoT platforms have built-in installation procedures and smartphone apps that use Bluetooth, NFC, or QR codes.
	-   **Integration with third-party software**. Most IoT platforms have a REST API or a Javascript API to access the backend data, and others have ready-made integrations with third-party services such as Salesforce or Google Cloud.
	-   **Device management**. IoT projects involve large numbers of IoT devices. Those devices may break or need to be replaced. This is where a device management feature is useful.
	-   **User management**. IoT systems are used by many individuals so having user management built into the system is essential to prevent unauthorized access and mistakes. Most, if not all, IoT platforms therefore include user management as an essential feature.
	-   **Software updates**. IoT systems are software-intensive and that software will need to be kept up-to-date. IoT platforms include mechanisms for updating software, even over-the-air for installed IoT devices.
	-   **Push notifications or email alerts**. In many cases, you want to alert users or customer support personnel when things happen in your IoT system. Many IoT platforms provide built-in support for alerts and notifications that you can tune to your specific use case.
	-   **Data analytics**. Some IoT platforms focus heavily on data analytics, statistics, and pattern recognition mechanisms as some IoT systems depend on this for their operation. And if the platform itself does not provide built-in analytics, most provide an API to which external analytics software can be attached.
	-   **Billing**. For some projects, billing is an important part of the solution, and there are some IoT platforms that support built-in or third-party billing solutions.
6. It reduces your risks and costs





# Types of IoT platform

- IoT cloud platforms (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, ...)
- IoT network provider (AT&T, Orange Business Services, Telefónica, Verizon, and Vodafone)
- IoT business platforms (for vertical applications and markets such as building management, smart industry,...)

- All these IoT platforms have common types of capabilities, with one IoT platform performing better in one area than another.
- It’s clear that a platform from a network operator typically will be stronger in the communications and network capacity area while platforms which were designed for application enablement offer stronger capabilities on that level, platforms from device manufacturers are stronger in device management and so forth.

---
- Enterprises should evaluate AEPs based on requirements in four areas:
	- a focus on the developer persona
	- having a flexible and scalable deployment model
	- operational sophistication
	- and a well-executed partnership strategy and platform ecosystem

---
The most common categories of IoT platforms are:

-   Cloud platforms (a.k.a. application enablement platforms)
	- This category of IoT platforms provides the core building blocks for your product, including consuming, transporting, storing, analyzing, and displaying data.
	- For context, some of the top players in the IoT Cloud platform space include:
		-   Microsoft Azure IoT
		-   AWS IoT
		-   Hitachi Vantara
		-   PTC
-   IoT connectivity platforms
	- Their role is to seamlessly manage the connectivity between your devices and your Cloud platform, across many cellular operators (or other types of specialized network operators such as SigFox).
	- These platforms often include additional functionality such as traffic monitoring, connectivity management, geolocation, device management, over-the-air updates, and device provisioning.
	- Examples of IoT connectivity platforms include
		- [Curiosity by Sprint](https://business.sprint.com/solutions/internet-of-things/),
		- [Jasper by Cisco](https://www.jasper.com/),
		- [IoT Accelerator by Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en/internet-of-things/iot-platform),
		- [Pelion by ARM](https://www.arm.com/products/iot/pelion-iot-platform).
-   IoT device platforms
	- if your application has additional requirements around visualization, data processing, digital twins, artificial intelligence (A.I), or machine learning (ML), an IoT analytics platform can accelerate your IoT development.
	-  Examples of IoT analytics platforms include
		- [Watson by IBM](https://www.ibm.com/watson),
		- [C3 AI](https://c3.ai/),
		- [SparkCognition](https://www.sparkcognition.com/),
		- [UpTake](https://www.uptake.com/).
-   Analytics platforms

There are 4 other types of platforms that are often referred to as “_IoT Platform_”:

-   **Connectivity / M2M platforms.** These platforms focus mainly on the connectivity of connected IoT devices via telecommunication networks (e.g., SIM-cards) but rarely on the processing and enrichment of different sets of sensor data. (An example of a connectivity platform is Sierra Wireless’ AirVantage)
-   **IaaS backends.** Infrastructure-as-a-service backends provide hosting space and processing power for applications and services. These backends used to be optimized for desktop and mobile applications but IoT is now also in focus. (An example is IBM Bluemix – not to be confused with IBM IoT Foundation)
-   **Hardware-specific software platforms.** Some companies that sell connected devices have built their own proprietary software backend. They like to refer to the backend as an IoT Platform. Since the platform is not open to anyone else on the market it is debatable whether one should call it an IoT Platform. (An example is Google Nest)
-   **Consumer/Enterprise software extensions.** Existing enterprise software packages and operating systems such as Microsoft Windows 10 are increasingly allowing the integration of IoT devices. Currently these extensions are often not advanced enough to classify as a full IoT Platform – but they may get there soon.


=> To create a true **IoT ecosystem**, where systems of systems interact and generate value from diverse streams of data, interoperability is essential. No one IoT platform will be able to cover the wide spectrum of existing and potential use cases yet to be envisaged.

New open source approaches where IoT platforms work together for the “_greater good_” are enjoying increasing success. Open source tools such as **Vorto – backed by the open Eclipse community** – are providing the missing link, implementing a common framework for information modelling that eases integration and promotes interoperability between platforms and the entire IoT ecosystem.

For example, PTC and Bosch Software Innovations collaboration is a prime example of a major technology alliance using Vorto to facilitate the integration and technical interplay between their two platforms.

	- **Connectivity & normalization:** brings different protocols and different data formats into one “_software_” interface ensuring accurate data streaming and interaction with all devices.
	-  **Device management:** ensures the connected “_things_” are working properly, seamlessly running patches and updates for software and applications running on the device or edge gateways.
	-  **Database:** scalable storage of device data brings the requirements for hybrid cloud-based databases to a new level in terms of data volume, variety, velocity and veracity.
	-  **Processing & action management:** brings data to life with rule-based event-action-triggers enabling execution of “_smart_” actions based on specific sensor data.
	-  **Analytics:** performs a range of complex analysis from basic data clustering and deep machine learning to predictive analytics extracting the most value out of the IoT data-stream.
	-  **Visualization:** enables humans to see patterns and observe trends from visualization dashboards where data is vividly portrayed through line-, stacked-, or pie charts, 2D- or even 3D-models.
	-  **Additional tools:** allow IoT developers prototype, test and market the IoT use case creating platform ecosystem apps for visualizing, managing and controlling connected devices.
	-  **External interfaces:** integrate with 3rd-party systems and the rest of the wider IT-ecosystem via built-in application programming interfaces (API), software development kits (SDK), and gateways.
	- 
		- Connectivity & Normalization: Every IoT platform starts with a connectivity layer. It has the function of bringing different protocols and different data formats into one “software” interface. This is necessary in order to ensure all devices can be interacted with and data is read correctly. Having all device data in one place and in one format is the basic necessity to monitor, manage, and analyze IoT devices. 
		- Device Management: The device management module of an IoT platform ensures the connected objects are working properly and its software and applications are updated and running. Tasks performed in this module include device provisioning, remote configuration, management of firmware/ software updates, and troubleshooting.
		- Database: Data storage is a central piece in an IoT platform. An IoT platform therefore usually comes with a cloud based database solution that is distributed across different sensor nodes. It should be scalable for big data and should be able to store both structured (SQL) and unstructured data (NoSQL).
		- Processing & Action Management: The data that is captured in the connectivity & normalization module and that is stored in the database gets brought to life in this part of the IoT platform. A rule-based event-action-trigger allows performance of “smart” actions based on specific sensor data. 
		- Additional Tools: Advanced IoT platforms often offer an additional set of tools for the developer and the manager of the IoT solution. Development tools allow the IoT developer to prototype and test the IoT case. Sometimes even in the form of whatyou-see-is-what-you-get-editors (WYSIWYG) that lets you create simple smartphone apps for visualizing and controlling connected devices.
		- Analytics: Many IoT use cases go beyond action-management and require complex analytics to get the most out of the IoT data-stream. The analytics engine encompasses all dynamic calculations of sensor data, from basic data clustering to deep machine learning. 
		- Data Visualization: Sometimes also referred to as “visual analytics,” data visualization presents a much-underrated part of the IoT platform. The combination of human eye and brain is still far superior to most analytic and rule-based engines. That is why data visualization is so important: it enables humans to see patterns and observe trends. Visualization comes in the form of line-, stacked-, or pie charts, 2D- or even 3D-models.The visualization dashboard that is available to the manager of the IoT platform is often also included in the prototyping tools that an advanced IoT platform provides. 
		- External Interfaces: IoT enabled businesses are rarely built standalone and on a green field. In established companies it is crucial that the Internet of Things integrates with existing ERP systems, management tools, manufacturing execution systems and the rest of the wider IT-ecosystem.

## How to choose a good IoT platform
```md
- TLDR: Questions for choosing a good IoT platform
	- How much does it satisfy your and other vendors' need now and in the future?
	- Is the ecosystem it in suitable for your use cases?
	- How user-friendly and effective is it in performing essential tasks?
	- Is it open, interoperable and developer-friendly?
	- How is its scalability and interoperability?
	- Does it have a good, end-to-end security?
	- What is its pricing, hidden cost?
```

- Among many criteria in selecting the best IoT platform, you should ask following questions:
	- What is the track record of the IoT (business) platform vendor?
		- Base:
			- Has the vendor been adapting to evolving market and technology realities?
			- What projects has the platform been deployed for and what were the results?
			- What is the roadmap of the vendor and does that roadmap fit with yours?
			- Does it look as if it will still be around tomorrow?
			- Industry recognition?
			- Consortia? (the platform dev team)
		- In sort: 
			- Adaptation to reality including market and technology
			- Real-world results and opinions
			- Developing roadmap
	- How does the ecosystem of alliances, channel partners and overall ecosystems of the vendor look like?
		- Base:
			- Is it part of stable ecosystems and/or does it have good ecosystems itself?
			- Does its go-to-market approach (you will need channel partners, niche experts, system integrators and so on) include the use cases you have in mind?
			- Does it have a vertical approach or a vertical ecosystem for your specific type of business/industry?
		- In sort:
			- Its ecosystem
			-  Does its go-to-market approach include your use cases
			- Vertical ecosystem for your specific type of business/industry?
	- How user-friendly and effective is the IoT platform in performing/enabling essential tasks?
		- Base:
			- How long does it take to onboard new IoT devices?
			- Is it rather ‘zero touch’ or does onboarding take too much time? 
			- Does it work with a third-party zero touch (and secure) device onboarding/provision/management systems?
			- What about the time it takes users to perform other tasks?
			- How user-friendly are interfaces and functions, whether it concerns communication protocols, visualization, decision-making, the various applications in a scope of use cases it supports?
		- In sort:
			- user-friendly and effective
	- Is it an open, interoperable and developer-friendly platform?
		- Base:
			- What cloud platforms are used? What programming languages?
			- How easy is application enablement? Are there pre-packaged data and application features?
			- How well does it connect with the business applications and other IoT applications you need and want?
			- Does it support the proper standards, devices, communication technologies, etc.?
		- In sort: developer-friendly
	- How scalable is the platform?
		- Base:
			- Again: you don’t just select an IoT platform for the right here and now. By the time your IoT deployment is finished there will probably be new opportunities, possibilities and innovations, requiring your IoT platform to support far more IoT devices than in an initial project. This has implications on many levels including the mentioned onboarding, security, bandwidth, latency, performance and perhaps even more protocols and most likely interoperability with additional solutions and providers of services.
		- In sort: Scalability in onboarding, security, bandwidth, latency, performance and perhaps even more protocols and most likely interoperability with additional solutions and providers of services.
	- What about security? Although we’ll look at security in a scope of edge capabilities below we of course need to mention it among the many IoT platform selection criteria overall.
		- And it’s more than a matter of authentication, certification and encryption or about just a few parts of the overall IoT stack such as IoT devices or communication protocols and networks. While edge capabilities typically are seen as adding to security for several reasons, IoT projects and deployments need security by design in an end-to-end way (and with legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Regulation making waves across the globe right now soon also privacy by design in affected use cases involving personal data and identifiers). Security plays on all levels of the IoT stack so certainly also in selecting the best IoT platform for your needs, use cases and roadmap.

- If you are not familiar with the IoT space, it’s a good idea to get a third-party perspective from industry analysts like Gartner or IoT Analytics.


- Here are 5 key areas to look for when selecting an IoT platform:
	- **Reputable company.** IoT is risky enough as is. Trusting the core of your product to an unknown company might backfire. Make sure you evaluate their reputation, stability, financials, and track record.
	-  **Large ecosystem.** IoT is so big that there’s no way a single company can dominate it all. Looking for a company with a strong app and partner ecosystem will be a good investment in optionality and expansion. Most of the top IoT platform providers don’t do hardware themselves, but have a strong partner ecosystem to pull from. That is always a good sign.
	-  **Open APIs.** Extensibility will be key, so make sure you select a provider that gives you programmatic access to as much of their functionality as possible.
	-  **Vertical focus.** Aligning with a vendor that understands your industry is always a plus. Their solution will be designed to handle your type of data, analytics, and even help you comply with industry regulations.
	-  **Strong onboarding**. Adopting a new platform is not trivial. Look for companies that have a strong solutions department (or professional services) that can train your team, help you with the architecture, and guide you through the proof of concept stage.
