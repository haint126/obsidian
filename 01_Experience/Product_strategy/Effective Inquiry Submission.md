# Example of A Good Inquiry Submission
- Point of Contact: VP of Security Information Architect at XYZ corp.
- Outcome: The client would like to implement a single-sign-on solution using the Microsoft Operating system, including several Sequel licenses. Gartner Consulting is conducting a review of their internal systems to determine the best product. They are considering Microsoft Forefront Identity Manager.
- Specific: Their biggest concern is around staffing for the implementation. Should they insource or outsource? What kind of skill sets do they need? What can they do internally?
	- If they outsource, how do they manage after implementation? They will have to support the service going forward, encompassing several agencies.
- Expectations Set: They expect an initial Analyst inquiry call to determine direction and strategy, and several follow-up calls if they outsource.
- Due Date: April 1st

# What to do
- Preparation before the Inquiry Call
	- Study the research in advance
	- Prepare 2-3 questions to analyst
- During the Inquiry Call
	- Give analyst overview of the purpose for this call
	- Questions to be asked at the end of the call (5min) to utilize more time for analyst to share insights
	- Only main contact point to ask questions to avoid confusion
- After the Inquiry Call
	- Study further researches sent by analyst (if any)
	- Follow-up to schedule next inquiry call for deep dive discussion (if needed)
