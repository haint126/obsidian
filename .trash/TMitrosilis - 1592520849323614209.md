A famous psychologist revealed the secrets to building an elite mindset.

Here they are (and how you can apply them):

In simple terms, mindset is how you view + process the world.

It’s the foundation of our thoughts + behaviors.

Carol Dweck is one of the world’s top voices on the topic.

Her book "Mindset" has 2M+ copies in print.

Here are 5 tips from Deck to help you build an elite mindset:

CHALLENGE YOUR BELIEFS

Mindset is rooted in beliefs.

What you believe about:

• your talent
• your abilities
• your potential
• others around you

Fixed mindsets believe qualities are set in stone.

Growth mindsets believe these qualities can improve over time.

Fixed mindset beliefs:

• Your talent is what it is
• You’re intelligent or not
• You’re “wired that way”

Growth mindset beliefs:

• Your talent can be cultivated
• Your intelligence can be improved
• You can choose new behaviors any time

Action: Examine your beliefs.

• Where do they align with a fixed mindset?
• Where do they align with a growth mindset?

Building an elite mindset begins with believing you can change your mindset.

NURTURE A LOVE OF LEARNING

If you have kids — or are ever around kids — watch how quickly they learn.

Our youngest daughter is 2.5 months old, and she changes *daily*.

This is true for all babies. Each one is born with a drive to learn.

But somewhere between childhood and adulthood, our drive to learn is often extinguished.

We stop being concerned with learning and start worrying about being successful.

This is based on a shift in mindset.

A growth mindset views learning as exciting. 

Challenges are opportunities to form new connections and grow.

A fixed mindset views learning as threatening. 

Learning comes with failure, and failure threatens our sense of self.

Action: Celebrate the learning process

We need challenges to grow.

Building a world where we’re perfectly successful is the perfect way to NOT grow.

As Dweck says in her book: “Becoming is better than being.”

Never halt your journey of learning and becoming.

DO THINGS THAT TAKE EFFORT

Effort is a polarizing topic.

Fixed mindsets view giving effort as a risk. Why?

• “Geniuses” shouldn’t need effort
• Actually trying eliminates your excuses

A fixed mindset worries about judgment and perfection.

Giving effort undermines both.

Growth mindsets view effort as essential.

Tennis legend Billie Jean King has a great framing:

“What do you want to look back and say?”

If it’s “I could have been,” then play it safe and protect your fragile identity.

If it's "I gave everything I had," then take a bold shot.

Action: Embrace the “risk” of effort

Where can you give more effort right now?

What potential failure are you shying away from?

Choose a growth mindset and go for it.

RESIST LABELING

The Polgar family has produced three of the best female chess players ever.

Susan Polgar described her father’s mindset:

“My father believes that innate talent is nothing, that [success] is 99 percent hard work. I agree with him.”

Why does this matter?

We label talented kids:

• “My son is a great football player”
• “My daughter is the artist in the family”
• “Riley next door is the smartest kid at school”

These “compliments” set an expectation.

Worse, they create a belief that other people can define you.

Action: Resist labeling yourself or others

Pay attention to where you use labels in your life (we all do).

Make a deliberate effort to strip them away.

If you want to praise someone, make it about effort, learning, growth and the process of improvement.

GROWTH > GENIUS

We’ve talked about individual mindset.

What about organizational mindset?

Like people, all organizations develop a mindset.

Dweck participated in a study of Fortune 500 companies.

It was revealing, to say the least.

Key findings:

• Orgs with a fixed mindset build a “culture of genius”
• Orgs with a growth mindset build a “culture of development”

When talent is celebrated, it encourages selfish behavior. 

When growth is celebrated, it encourages curiosity and collaborative behavior.

Action: Value talent but celebrate growth

On a personal level:

Take action to continually expand your talents. They are malleable. 

On an organizational level:

Review the mindset and behaviors your culture encourages. 

Make changes to foster a culture of growth over genius.

To recap, 5 tips to build an elite mindset:

• Resist labeling
• Growth > genius
• Challenge your beliefs
• Do things that take effort
• Nurture a love of learning

I hope these ideas help you and your teams build stronger mindsets.
