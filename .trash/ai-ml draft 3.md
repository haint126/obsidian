October 2020

Reading time: 5 minutes

**The software industry’s usual approach to interviewing and hiring is terrible**.

I’m keeping an evergreen list about problems that exist and what people are doing about it.

The list is roughly alphabetized by title, with a few short notes to remind me about key points. Suggestions for additions are welcome!

    -   They do resume blind interviews.
    -   They suggest grading on “max skill”. Look for a strong reason to hire instead of looking for everyone to agree.
