# Machine learning project lifecycle
In a Machine learning project, there are 4 main phases:

## Time spend on different parts in a ML project
When doing a ML project, most of the time is spent in preparing data

## Roles in ML project
The job of preparing data falls on MLOps.

## What is good data?
A good dataset is needed to fulfill all below criteria.

## Importance of label consistence in small dataset
A dataset is needed to be either well labeled or large enough to counteract the noise.

## Clean vs noisy data
To improve the dataset, you can either increase the dataset or clean it.
In the example below, cleaning 500 samples give the same result as increase the dataset to ~1300 samples
