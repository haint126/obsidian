# What’s your perspective of Data team in companies where the main product is not Data? Should Data be in a leading or supporting role?

- The position of data team in the company depends on whether Data is a cost center or a profit center.
	- If Data is a part of cost center, the maximum value it can provide is 100% of the cost involved.
	- If Data is a part of profit center, the maximum value it can provide is infinite. (Google ads system)
- The team position also depends on the amount of trust they have.
	- If they can earn the company trust and demonstrate that data can add value, data can plays a leading role
	- On the other hand, a Data team who has lost their trust can only play the supporting role

## How do you increase collaboration between data and the rest of the organization? How do you encourage stakeholders to be more data-savvy beyond looking at dashboards?

There are three main mechanisms 
- Be recognized by potential market
	- Use internal newsletter to spread collaboration results with various stakeholders
		- => Raise awareness about the data team to the stakeholders
		- ==> Bring in business from other stakeholders
	- Present the team's work with the company's marketplace
		- => Consult with each country on their key needs 
		- => Raise awareness about the data team to the business development and marketing team 
- Be recognized by other teams using Friday happy hour
	- Provide food and drink for the team to get together
	- Sometimes, members from other teams will join and share their problems
	- => Opportunities
- Give data-interested stakeholders means to access the data 
	- => Some might actually start playing with the data themselves

# How do you work with business to define the right problems and prioritize solving them? Can you give some concrete examples?

- Being curious and growing a thick skin to ask **"Why?"**
> _“Could you improve the rank of products that are [Fulfilled by Lazada](https://www.lazada.sg/helpcenter/about-fulfilled-by-lazada-fbl-products-4021.html) (FBL)?”_ I thought the request made sense. We want to rank products that use our services higher and incentivize merchants to use FBL. Nonetheless, I decided to ask “Why?”.
> 
> _“Because those products that are fulfilled by Lazada are delivered faster.”_ Again, very reasonable response. We want customers to get their products faster. Nonetheless, at the risk of sounding dumb, I decided to ask “Why?” again.
> 
> _“Because when it’s delivered faster, we get fewer complaints about late deliveries.”_ Ah, now the root cause emerges. They want to rank products that are fulfilled by Lazada higher to reduce customer complaints about late deliveries.
> 
> But IMHO, this was not a product ranking problem; instead, it was a delivery forecasting problem. Our forecasts were underestimating the time it took to deliver products when sellers choose to ship the products themselves (e.g., via 3rd-party or dropshipping). In this case, we choose to tackle this problem by improving the delivery forecasting algorithm instead of tweaking the product ranking system.


# As a senior/lead in the team, with knowledge across the company to keep on top of, how do you find a balance and avoid being overwhelmed with such scope?

- As you become more senior, it’s inevitable that you lose touch with some of the details that you had in your previous role.
- As a senior, you should not expect yourself to know, do, and deliver everything, especially if you’re in a leadership position
- Instead, your role is to provide guidance and intuition to the team, mentor and grow them, and trust them to make the right decisions.
- Also, as a senior or lead, you should be more focused on business outcomes:
	- How do you identify the most pressing problems that needs your attention?
	- How do you structure the problem and solution and help your team to execute it effectively?
	- How do you hire, train, and motivate your team to deliver?

# What’s your opinion about using data from an excel spreadsheet? It usually comes from ops/admin and business/product teams who want the data to be accessible via monitoring

- It is a pain but tolerable as long as it’s automated.
- If it is non-automated, it might has an inconsistent schema and format.
- Alternatively, you can ask for the direct source of the excel spreadsheet
