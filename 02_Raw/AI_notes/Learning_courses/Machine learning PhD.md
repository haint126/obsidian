- Don’t get distracted by lots of things like lectures, reading groups etc unless its relevant to your research.
- Everybody thinks their own topic is lame.

- In conference, network, discuss with other researchers. Attend workshops, tutorials or panels where current research is being discussed.
- Collaborate with people with complementary skills and are interested in the same niche.
