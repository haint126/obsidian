THREAD: The hardest things about learning deep learning online (based on personal experience):

✅ outmaneuvering thousands of engineers at Reddit, Netflix, Twitter, etc, fighting for your attention
✅ carrying on through long periods of time where you  don't notice progress
✅ feeling lost 98% of the time and not knowing if your approach makes sense
✅ identifying and trusting good advice among so much noise
✅ finding the time to study when being a parent, a student, an employee
✅ learning how to pick projects to work on for self-study
✅ justifying to yourself the cost of resources and hardware
✅ powering through the fear of sharing your work publicly
✅ not being taken aback if no one notices your hard work
✅ understanding how little math is involved in doing machine learning and convincing yourself to learn all the things that actually do matter
✅ realizing that train - validation - test split is the most important concept there exists
