# TLDR
1. Creating a digital "first impression"
2. Using a value-driven approach
3. Combining specificity with support
4. Making relevant intros
5. Using DM's effectively

# 1. Create a clear & compelling profile
- Start with a clear and compelling profile.
	- This is your "digital first impression", just like a first impression offline.
- Your profile cheat sheet:
	- Banner: Show off your brand
	- Headshot: Clean and polished
	- Bio: What are you doing & what can people expect?
	- Pinned Tweet: Provide deeper context on your journey
- Answer this: “What am I doing that's interesting enough for someone to follow me?”

# 2. Create a value-driven relationship approach
- You are one of 1,000 people trying to reach out to someone, how can you differentiate yourself?
- => Provide value upfront with no expectation of immediate return.

# 3. Combining specificity with support

## Use a relevant, specific compliment:
- Tell them something specific they’ve done that you enjoy.
- If you liked a specific podcast/article, tell them why, and what impact it had on you.
- Use a soft “out”:
	- i.e. "No need to reply, just wanted to share how it impacted me!"

## Permissionless support:
- Support someone w/o asking their permission.
- You could share their content in your newsletter or create a visual of their Tweet.

# 4. Make a meaningful introduction
- Connecting 2 people who can help one another is powerful.
- Solve their problem with a connection & you leapfrog hundreds of other people trying to build that relationship.

# 5. Use DMs effectively to build relationships
