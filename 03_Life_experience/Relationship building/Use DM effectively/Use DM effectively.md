DMs are what make you grow fast, bring in the sales, and build leverage that nobody can compete with.

Here are the 5 steps:
## 1) Find Someone You Actually Want To DM

- Don't DM people you have nothing in common with or don't care about.

- Send DMs to people:

	- You are inspired by
	- You would want to work with
	- You would want to be friends with
	- You see potential for mutual benefit

- This is crucial.
