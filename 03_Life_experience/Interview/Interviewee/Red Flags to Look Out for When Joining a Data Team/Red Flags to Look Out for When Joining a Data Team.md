# How do I find time for all these questions

- Don’t have to ask all the questions - focus on what’s important to you
	- It’s hard to find a role that doesn’t have any red flags
- You can ask for follow-up chats with the hiring manager, and another member of the team
	- You can [reverse interview](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/reverse-interviewing/) them


# Data: No data, or data that’s poorly organized and/or inaccessible

- This can happen in:
	- Startup without critical mass of customers
	- B2B company that relies on partners for data
- They might have data, but it's stored in various formats with different schemas

- Without basic data infra in place, data scientists will likely be frustrated with the grind of data acquisition, organization, cataloging, and building pipelines

- => Questions for this flag:
	- What data is being generated or collected by your systems?
	- What are the key objects in your data, such as customers, items, or transactions, and what is the approximate number of new rows daily or monthly?
	- As a new joiner, how would I access the data?

# Roadmap: No/poor plan on how the team will deliver value to customers and the business

- Data science can spend too much time on research without tangible results
	- When lean times come, teams that don’t contribute to the business are likely first to be cut
	- It’s not healthy for your career and resume 

- => Questions for this flag:
	- How does the team deliver value to customers and the business?
	- What is your roadmap and planned deliverables for the quarter? And the year?
	- How does success look like for the team? What are the team’s KPIs?


# Role: Misaligned expectations on the role and career progression guidelines

- "data scientist" = "data analyst" in some company
- Clarify what the role entails, don’t make assumptions based on the job title
	- Get access to the team’s promotion guidelines and consider whether it aligns with your aspirations

- => Questions for this flag:
	- What should someone in this role deliver in the first 100 days? And the first year?
	- Of the most effective people in this role, what key skills and behaviors do they have?
	- How is success in this role defined and measured?
	- What does someone have to demonstrate to progress to the next level?


# Manager: Incompetent, lacks vision, abusive, etc

- Good boss differs from person to person
- Find out about the manager:
	- Ask the hiring manager to share the contact details of 2 - 3 people who used to work with them, people who can speak freely without fear of direct repercussion
	- Speak to the most tenured person on the team

- => Questions for this flag:
	- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the manager?
	- Did you enjoy working with the manager? Why or why not?
	- How did the manager support the team and help them grow?
	- Would/did you enjoy hanging out with the manager in a casual setting?


# Tooling: They use outdated or proprietary tools that are barely transferable to other roles

- Tools take time to learn but we lose touch if we stop using them for a prolonged period
- Using good tools makes the work more enjoyable

- => Questions for this flag:
	- What key tools does the team use in their day-to-day?
	- What is your tech stack?

# Org structure: The data science team rolls up to an unusual C-level

- Data team rolled up to CTO or CIO or VP Eng is fine
- I would be concerned if data team reported to the CFO or CMO

- => Questions for this flag:
	- Who does the data science team roll up to?
	- Who are the main stakeholders of the data science team?

# Iteration speed: The team moves too fast/slow for your liking

- Pick a pace that aligns with how fast you want to iterate

- => Questions for this flag:
	- What was the last thing the team shipped? How long did that take?
	- How many AB tests did the team conduct in the last month or quarter? What were the outcomes?
