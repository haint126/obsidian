# TLDR
- Start with a clear headline to answer 3 key questions
- Give your readers a reason to trust you
- Outline your main points
- Use bullets to list things
- Do not use conclusion to summarize
	- Use it for call to action:
		- More stories
		- Ask questions
		- Introduce your products
- Use template

# Why
- Great formatting hooks readers and keeps their eyes moving down the page.
	- The reader should be able to skim the subject line and "get it."
	- And then skim the subheads all the way to the end and "get it."
	- And then skim the first sentence of any given section and "get it."

# 1. Start with a clear subject line
- Your email newsletter subject is your headline
- Answering the 3 key questions all readers ask will give you a much greater chance of readers diving into your newsletter:
	- Is this for me?
	- What is this about?
	- Why should I read it?
- Some other clever tactics about writing subject lines:
	- Make it informal: use lower case.
	- Make it personal: use the reader’s name.
	- Make it recognizable: use a subject line that worked on you

## Examples
- Here's how it's done on the internet.

- And here’s how it’s done on Twitter.

- And this is what it looks like over email.

# 2. Give your readers a reason to trust you (even more)
- Your newsletter is an opportunity to deepen the trust you already have with your followers.
- Affirm your subscribers trust by giving them quality well-formatted content and reminding them that:
	- You have been doing this for X years
	- You've "done" the thing you are teaching them
	- Other credible people can vouch for your knowledge and expertise
- So, what is it for you? What makes you credible?
	- Is it how many hours you’ve spent doing this thing?
	- Is it because of some meaningful milestone you’ve achieved?
	- Is it the amount of years you’ve spent studying and practicing this thing?
- And if you don’t have any personal credibility, how might you be able to borrow that credibility from someone else?

## Examples
- In the email introduction below, we create credibility with the reader when we let them know that people are asking us questions on the very topic the reader has chosen to read about.

- Here’s another example: 
	- We dropped a link to our Digital Writing Fundamentals at the introduction in this post.
	- We have written other things on the internet and we have an opinion on the fundamentals.
	- This is credibility.

# 3. Outline your main points (before you start)
- Writing is not a linear process.
	- You don’t go from a blank page to finished.
	- You go from a blank page, to an outline, to filling in the outline, to polish and finish.
- First you clarify the organization of what you are writing, and then your color in the lines with:
	- Stories that create relatable moments
	- Examples that illustrate the point your making
	- Descriptions that help the reader grasp the concept
- Outline the main points in your newsletter and make them subheadings

## Examples
- In this example, you can see how reading the outline makes it easy for the reader to grasp what they are getting when they scan through the piece
- Also, notice how the “white spaces” are begging to be filled in.

# 4. Anytime you are listing things, use bullets
- Lists are better than paragraphs.
	- Write one declarative sentence.
	- Expand how or why in a few bullets.
	- Write one declarative conclusion sentence.
- This format is 10x easier for readers to skim than trying to pick through a 4-sentence paragraph.

## Examples
And in 1982, legendary marketer, David Ogilvy wrote an internal memo to the employees of his advertising agency titled "[How to write.](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1399879281652678664)"

# 5. Ditch the conclusion (if you want to)
- If your conclusion is just repeating everything you just said, you don’t need a conclusion.
- You are writing for impatient digital readers
	- If what you wrote was truly helpful and beneficial, they will read more content from you
	- Which means you should only write “conclusions” if they add something new to the newsletter
	- Don’t write a summary
- However, any reader that makes it to the end of your newsletter is likely to be interested in something else from you.
- => So, call your reader to action!
- Direct your readers to more of your content, or send them to a lead capture page to collect an email.
	- Point them to a product you have for sale. 
	- Show them where they can read your best stuff.
	- Ask them to reply with feedback or answer a question.
