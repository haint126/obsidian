# High Open Rates
- This measures:
	- How good your content is
	- How your content aligns to your audience’s needs
- A newsletter with 50k subs / 50% open rate is more valuable than one with 100k subs / 25% open rate.

# Month Over Month Growth
- Newsletters are not viral quality content doesn’t lead to huge growth.
- You need paid or organic social (ideally both).
- Plus, advertisers want new eyeballs on their brand for a long-term sponsor relationship.

# Flexibility & Care
- Be flexible as an operator.
- Newsletter business models involve partners:
	- Brand partners
	- Cross promotions
	- Agencies
- Being good to work with is a competitive advantage.

# Audience Data
- Don’t guess with who your audience is. You need concrete data.
- Use an anonymous audience info survey to get:
	- Age
	- Gender
	- Industry
	- Income
- It helps you tailor content, and it shows potential advertisers exactly who they’re paying to get in front of.

# Unique Click Through Rate
- Your CTR matters for:
	- Deliverability (more clicks → more primary inboxes)
	- Curated resources (proves engagement)
	- Ads (makes your partners money)
- For ads, benchmark your CTR by industry. Then sell spots to the best-performing industry.
