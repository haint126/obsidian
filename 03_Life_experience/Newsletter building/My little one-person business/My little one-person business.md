# 20 steps of my wild & strange journey:

## 1. Created lots of noise
- When I was just getting started, I looked at attention as my friend.
- I wrote content every day before I even had a business, just to find my voice.
- I started on LinkedIn.
- I shared my thoughts & observations about building a SaaS unicorn as the CRO.

## 2. Honed in on signals
- Inside all of that noise was some signals.
- Sometimes I bombed, and sometimes I struck a chord.
- The more I looked at what resonated, the more I doubled down.
- This allowed me to understand what people cared about.
- So, I kept writing & talking about it.

## 3. Built a service business
- My experience building SaaS was resonating. So I began creating more and more content about that.
- Founders sent me DMs asking questions.
- I responded to every single one.
- Once I had prospects in my funnel, I started consulting.

## 4. Found my ideal customers
- Inside your customer base is more signals.
- What are the commonalities between the customers you love & those who love you?
- Mine were early-stage SMB SaaS in the healthcare space. A space I was experienced in & loved.
- That became my ideal customer.

## 5. 2x'ed my rates
- With a well-defined niche, some happy customers, and testimonials, I 2x'ed my rates.
- I started creating more content that was even more targeted. This led to more conversations with ideal-fit prospects.
- I said no to any company outside of my niche.

## 6. Reduced my time
- With new rates, I could have worked the same and made 2x as much.
- Instead, I chose to work 50% of the time and make the same.
- I used that extra time to figure out how to scale income that was more automated.
- My goal had always been to get my time back.

## 7. Kept my eyes and ears open
- Something really interesting happened.
- In an attempt to find common problems to productize, I started rereading my LinkedIn DMs.
- I had some repetitive questions about SaaS sales, but I also had an inbox jammed with questions about LinkedIn itself.

## 8. Tested a hypothesis
- I had organically grown to 20k+ followers on LinkedIn & people wanted to know more.
- I had a hypothesis that this would be an easy info product I could create & sell.
- I put together a short course for $50 (more on price later) & wrote posts about it.

## 9. Made my first product
- I put the product for sale on Gumroad on April 16th, 2020.
- In the first month, I made $10,482.
- I was shocked.
- I now had my first digital product, but it was in a totally different niche than my service business.
- Honestly, this confused me.

## 10. Ran with it
- Over the next 15 months, I sold about $75k of the course.
- I posted about audience building on LinkedIn and found other ways to continue to land consulting clients. (VCs, news sites, blogs, SaaStr, etc)
- Even though it felt confusing, I continued to run with it.

## 11. Tripled down
- After the course was outdated, people started asking for a new version.
- I rebuilt the course, but this time charged $150.
- The earlier $50 price was my "trust tripwire".
- I charged $50, delivered 100x worth the price, and built trust w. a loyal customer base.

## 12. Marketed aggressively
- With 100% of my LinkedIn content focused on audience growth, and a product directly related to that content, sales took off.
- My previous course grossed $75k in 15 months.
- The second version has grossed $186k in 3 months.
- Next up...

## 13. I began creating an army
- At the halfway point of my course, people are encouraged to leave a testimonial and sign up for an affiliate program.
- I built the same automation at the conclusion of the course.
- I now have 800+ affiliates that have generated $110,000 in revenue.

## 14. Built a community
- As sales picked up, my interest in consulting faded.
- I was doing $2k per day in info products and wanted to run with that.
- I opened a private community for creators and charged $199.
- Those who completed my course were prompted to join.

## 15. Made a difficult decision
- I loved my community but realized that it didn't work with my personality.
- It was a $15k MRR business, but I felt like I had to be "on" 24/7.
- That wasn't the life I wanted to build.
- 15 months after starting it, I made a decision to shut it down.

## 16. Reinvested my time
- With way more free time now, I decided to start Tweeting.
- Using what I knew about growing on LinkedIn, I was able to hit 75k followers in about 6 months.
- This provided a new channel to build more stuff.
- So I did.

## 17. Created a 2nd digital course
- I was doing a podcast with [@dickiebush](https://twitter.com/dickiebush) and [@Nicolascole77](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77) about how I built a system for writing content.
- The 500+ people on the call seemed to be amazed by it.
- That led to my 2nd course, The Content Operating System.

## 18. Added MRR
- I noticed that each week I was spending time creating content templates for myself.
- What if my audience wanted those too?
- I tested it as a $9 upsell on each course.
- 8 months later it has 1,700+ subscribers.
- Almost $14k MRR from something I was already doing.

## 19. Started a newsletter
- In January of 2021, I launched my newsletter, The Saturday Solopreneur.
- I was determined to deliver one piece of actionable advice each Saturday AM that could be read in 4 minutes or less.
- In the last 11 months, I've grown it to 60k+ subs.

## 20. Added sponsorships
- With over 60k subs, I can charge for each issue to be sponsored.
- I have 2 slots per issue, per week, that sell for $1,250.
- Now each weekly newsletter is paying $2,500, and people are getting their brand and business in front of a ton of readers.
- Finally, here's what my business revenue looks like:
	- Products: $1.54M
	- Consulting: $1.17M
	- Community: $130k
	- MRR: $84k
	- Sponsorships: $76k
- A few last notes of potential interest:
	1. I no longer do anything SaaS-related.
	2. I don't do any paid advertising of any kind.
	3. I don't have any employees, but I do have a wife that helps me stay very organized.
