# A few principles before we start
- A few principles before we start:
	 - We want repeat customers
	 - We want you to get paid fairly
- That means quality of subscribers > number of subscribers.
	- Partners would rather see a list of 50k and 50% opens than 100k with 25% opens.
- But at the same time partners then care about list size
	- Many partners won’t be interested until you hit 10-15k readers
		- -> Before then you’re best focusing on growth

# Placement for your ads
- You should sell a “primary placement” that appears near the top of your newsletter.
- Standard is:
	 - 100-125 words
	 - 2-3 links
	 - 1 image
- This is your highest priced slot.

# Pricing
- You want to get advertisers in on
	- a Cost per Click (CPC)
	- OR Cost per Thousand (CPM) basis.

## Cost per Click
- CPC is exactly what it sounds for each click you drive, the advertiser pays you ~$3.
- Standard is $2-$4, depending on your audience quality.

## Cost per Thousand
- People refer to CPM on a per open basis so $40 / 1000 opens.
	- Others refer to it on a per subscriber basis.
	- These are very different. Be clear upfront to avoid confusion.
- Typically, **CPM is the preferred** measure by you the writer because it measures the value of impressions.

## Affiliate
- Many advertisers will first offer an affiliate.
	- I recommend you **turn that down**.
	- They’ll say it “aligns incentives” but you can push back.
- Remember:
	- Affiliate links don’t always work technically
	- A reader may see an ad and then search the product themselves

# How to find your ad partners

## What they want to know
- When you find ad partners, they’ll want to know a few things:
	- List size
	- Open rate and click rate
	- Audience demographics
- Demographics include where your audience lives, gender, income, industry, and typical role.

## Collect their data
- After landing a partner ,send them a simple form to collect data. You’ll need:
	- Tracking link
	- Example copy
	- Image (if you allow them)
- Don’t overcomplicate this.

## Keep it your newsletter
- If you don’t vibe with a brand, don’t work with them.
- If you don’t like their copy, edit it to match your voice.
	- The more the final copy matches your voice, the better the ad will perform.
