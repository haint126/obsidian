# Set a Daily “Make Something” Goal
- Grab a sticky note and write “make something today"--stick it to your computer monitor.
	- Your goal is simply to make something--anything--every single day.
- Set the bar low and make it achievable.
	- Creation will start to become a habit.

# Document What You Make
- Start documenting your daily creation.
	- Post it online with a few sentences about what it means to you.
	- Was it an idea floating around in your head for months? A mini essay you've been meaning to write? Code that you finally figured out?
	- Document it.

# Decide Before You Start
- Too often I sit down at my computer and wonder what I should work on. That’s dangerous.
- The Trick: Decide what you are going to do beforehand.
	- Write a to do list beforehand, then immediately jump into that first task.
- Remove the guesswork.

# Separate Creation & Consumption
- Computers are for creating, not consuming.
	- Go to all your social sites and sign out. Set up your computer as your creation hub.
	- Use your phone or tablet for consumption.
- One device is used for creating, the other for consuming.

# Know Who You Serve
- If you try to create for everyone you’ll quickly run out of both ideas and motivation.
	- Instead figure out exactly who you are serving.
- Identify your audience and niche. Develop an understanding of your "customer" and what they need.
	- The ideas will flow.

# Schedule Time for Creation
- Take control and reserve time for creating.
	- Go to your calendar and set aside 30 minutes blocked for focused creation.
	- Then when you get the notification you already have the time set aside and it is clear what you should start on.

# Quit Slack
- At ConvertKit we have a simple shorthand for informing everyone else you are entering focused work: cmd + Q.
	- It means "I’m quitting Slack to focus for a while."
- I always underestimate the cost of maintaining conversations while creating. It’s hard and I’m bad at it.

# Teach What You Just Learned
- Teaching everything you know can be intimidating, so let’s start by teaching what you just learned.
- Create a new 30 minute event every Friday that says, "What did you learn this week?"
	- Look back at your week and share something that you learned.

# Build a Streak & Don’t Break the Chain
- I built my entire blog through one habit: writing 1,000 words a day.
	- That turned into writing 3 books and many blog posts.
- The key: I built a streak that I didn’t want to break--650 days in a row!
	- Build a streak of creating every day.

# Block Troublesome Sites
- If simply signing out isn’t enough, you can use software to block an entire website.
	- The SelfControl app for OSX will block a series of sites for a set amount of time.
- Signing out is usually enough of a barrier, but this app takes it to the next level!

# Know Your Outcome
- Don’t just create for the sake of creating.
	- Work towards something.
	- Whether it’s launching the course, reaching 500 YouTube subscribers, writing a book, or launching a new feature--have a specific goal to chip away at.
- Vision keeps you on track!

# Create a Deadline, Raise the Stakes
- It’s not a real goal without a deadline.
	- Set your launch date in advance. Then give $50 to a friend and have them only give it back to you if hit the goal.
	- Put some skin in the game. Make sure you feel the pain if you miss your goal!

# Go Public
- Even better, make it a public challenge.
- I started ConvertKit through The Web App Challenge: my public challenge to build a web app to $5,000/mo in 6 months.
	- My community rallied around me to help make it happen. All because I took my journey public.
