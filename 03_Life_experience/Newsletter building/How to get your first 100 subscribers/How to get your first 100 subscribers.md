# 1. Select a specific skill you'll teach to a specific group of people (e.g. app design for developers)
- Most people the mistake of staying generic for too broad of an audience.
- That's a sure way to never get traction.

# 2. Reach out to 10+ people in that niche, tell them about your newsletter, ask them to subscribe.
- Say, "I'm starting a new newsletter about ______. Can I add you as one of my first subscribers?"
- Text everyone you know who could be interested.

# 3. Then for everyone who subscribes ask them two questions:
- A) What's your biggest frustration with learning [topic]?
	- Turn the frustrations into a list of topics to write about that you know will resonate.
- B) Where do you go online right now to learn about [topic]?
	- Question B will give you a list of the sites and communities you can participate in. That's subreddits to write content for, places to guest post, and more.
	- You probably have your own list, but I've found this question always gives me communities I hadn't heard of before.

# Now write a weekly article for your list, ask them to share it, and also promote it in those communities.
- Pitch each community on a custom guest post. When they approve it, send it to your newsletter as well.
- Each piece of content should have a newsletter CTA.
- Repeat this process of direct outreach, learning frustrations, writing content, & promoting it with a link back to your newsletter until you hit 100 subscribers.
- I've seen people do it in as little as a week or as much as 2 months.
