# Why DM?
- This will be in the context of networking — not direct outreach to land clients
- Why would you DM people to network?
	- To put your name in more peoples' mouths
	- To leverage their audience for growth (this is how you grow as a beginner)
	- To make like-minded friends that would be hard to find in real life
- Anyone that has grown an audience on any platform understand this:
	- DMs are what make you:
		- Grow fast
		- Bring in the sales
		- Build leverage that nobody can compete with.

# 1. Find Someone You Actually Want To DM
- This is crucial.
- Don't DM people you have nothing in common with or don't care about.
- Send DMs to people:
	- You are inspired by
	- You would want to work with
	- You would want to be friends with
	- You see potential for mutual benefit

# 2. Inspired Compliment
- Find a piece of their content, work, or current projects that you are truly inspired by.
- Send it to them and tell them how it resonated with you.
- People love praise — and per the principle of reciprocity — will feel obligated to repay this soft favor.

# 3. Show Interest In Them
- This is communication 101 — showing interest makes you interesting.
- Ask them about
	- Their goals
	- What they are building
	- What they do for work
- This gives you the opportunity to give value (even if YOU don't have value to give right now).

# 4. Lead With Value
- This is the part that trips most people up.
- Your first options are to:
	- See where you can help
	- Send actionable tips
	- Send resources, systems, or videos you've created
- Don't go straight for a transaction when you haven't given anything first.
- If you have no value to give you can:
	- Send a resource that can help them with their goals
	- Connect them with someone else in your network
	- Just continue having a good conversation and showing interest
- Show that you are interested in helping them.

# 5. Get On A Call
- Making that "face-to-face" interaction is priceless.
- Nobody can see you, your personality, or your mannerisms via text.
- You can also take the conversation to somewhere like Telegram and send voice messages to make yourself seem more human.

# 6. Follow Up With Value
- Remember their goals and keep an eye out for any content, resources, or people you can send their way.
- When you find something or someone, send it to them.
- "I remember you telling me about X goal. I found this today and thought you'd find it helpful."

# 7. Follow Up With An Ask
- If you are trying to grow an audience as a beginner, this is for you.
	- Write content that was inspired by your conversation with the other person.
	- Send it to them after you post and mention that they inspired it.
- Why?
	- At a minimum, they will engage with it and get more eyes on your content (meaning more followers — if the content is good).
- This is how you grow an audience without being needy.
	- And, the connections you made don't just disappear. You cultivate them over time.

# Bonus tips:
1. Talk like you would text a friend
2. Don't be hyper-professional, let people breathe
3. Detach from any desire to make money or receive anything in return
4. Do this with people of all audience sizes, not just behemoths. Lifelong friends are made this way.
