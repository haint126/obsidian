# 1. Consistency
- Successful creators know that you have to create every single day to see meaningful results.
- Write every day.
- Publish every week.

# 2. Resilience
- It’s scary to put your work out there. It’s easier to criticize from the sidelines than to create in the arena.
- Feedback won’t always be positive and encouraging. Disconnect your ego from what you create.
- A thick skin is key to not taking it personally.

# 3. Longevity
- Real results take time.
- Showing up every day is important, but meaningful results come from consistency applied over a long period of time

# 4. Focus
- There’s always something new to chase. Don’t get distracted by shiny objects.
- Learn the power of saying no.
- Successful creators are able to channel their effort into fewer projects to get better results.

# 5. Charge
- Creators have a tendency to want to give it all away for free.
- Don’t.
- Charging for your work enables you to invest in your future and build a sustainable business.

# 6. Ask
- Successful creators are curious.
- They know they don’t have all the answers, so they ask questions to get ideas for new problems to solve, content to create, and ways to serve their fans.
- Never stop learning.

# 7. Rest & Recover
- Too many creators get burned out by always pushing to do more.
- Taking time to rest well means you can keep creating in a sustainable way.
- Create hard, recover harder.
