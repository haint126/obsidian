![[03_Life_experience/Entrepreneur/_How to build a successful one-person business/one person business.png]]

# Brand
- A brand is meant to attract followers.
- As a one-person business, YOU are the brand.
- The question:
	- What are you leading people towards?
	- What big goal are you working towards in your life?

## Brand mission
- While there are other important aspects to a brand like:
	- Brand colors (your fav colors)
	- Brand feel and tone (your tone)
	- ...
- The brand mission and message are the most important
	- If your big goal is to make $1 million, your brand mission is:
		- Help 1000 people make $1 million
- That is how you position yourself whether you have zero experience or not.
	- Don't get too caught up in it right now.
	- Your goals can (and should) pivot when you find a better path.

## To summarize:
- Your personal brand is how you display your value in public, where anyone can find and follow you.
- Your perceived value is determined by:
	- What you are building
	- The lessons you are passing down on your journey.
- But how do you attract people to your brand?

# Content
- Your job is to become a one-person media company.

## Media and how to deliver media
- Media is how you:
	- Capture attention
	- Deliver free value
	- Get in front of the entire internet.
- There's paid media (ads) and organic media (social growth).
	- Both are useful.
	- My favorite combination is both.
	- I stay far away from paid ads on specific platforms (for now).
- I would rather pay someone with a following to promote my work.
	- So I have something to show for it.
	- It is not just a one-off sale, but a leverageable following that I can nurture.

## Your content
- The thing that people struggle with the most is figuring out what to talk about.
	- Stop worrying about your niche.
	- Your niche is the combination of your genuine interests.
	- Your niche is you.
	- You are interesting because of what you are interested in.
- How to:
	- Write down 3 broad interests.
		- Example:
			- Bodybuilding
			- Mindset
			- Online business
	- Then, break those down into pieces that you can research and use as inspiration.
- **Your domain of mastery is what you are learning to achieve your goals (as a brand).**

## From consumer to researcher
- Your job is to switch from full-time consumer to full-time researcher.
- You are learning about your interests in relation to your goal (so you have something to apply every teaching to and gain experience).
- Become an expert in your domain and share your discoveries.

## Position in the market
- "How do I position myself in the market?"
	- Don't overcomplicate this.
	- Just be honest with exactly what you are doing to achieve your goals.
- [@SahilBloom](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom) & [@thejustinwelsh](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh) are great examples of this.

# Product

## Starter product: MVO (Minimum viable offer)
- You can start with a full fledged digital product, nobody said you can't, but it isn't optimal.
- Instead, start with an MVO (Minimum viable offer)
- There are 2 options for MVO:
	- A single-skill **freelance** service
		- When studying a marketable skill like web design.
	- A pack of **consulting** calls
		- When studying an interest like health, performance, or mindset.
		- You can sell these for $500-$1000 right out of the gate.
- I recommend people go with option 2 no matter what.
	- You will have much more success (and potential scalability) if you become an educator instead of a freelancer.
	- You can teach marketable skills 1 on 1 instead of doing it for someone else.
- Why ?
	- Why start with this? Because it's easier to sell (with direct outreach) when you don't have a large audience.
- Other way:
	- There are ways around this... like writing a thread, getting it in front of someone elses 100,000+ audience, and selling a product there.

## General path
- Most people should follow this path:
	- Start a service business
	- Sell a beginner-level service
	- Learn complementary skills
	- Make your service better
	- Charge more & get results
	- Productize your service
	- Use the results to sell to the audience you've been building

## Choose your product to build
- How do you productize your service, or even know where to start with the service itself?
	- Easy, build something that helps you achieve your goals faster
	- Or, build something you would have wanted to achieve your goals faster.
- All of my products were either a system I built for myself (to improve my life or business) — or a system I would have wanted.
	- If I'm a writer, I build out a Notion dashboard with templates to help with my writing (or my clients).
	- For a web designer - create steps for building a website and a project management dashboard
	- For a productivity guy - create a habit tracker and todo list for yourself (like I did)
- As you spot problems that hold you back, your system gets better.
- Then, all you have to do is:
	- Choose a software (like gumroad)
	- Record loom videos on how to use the system
	- Write a curriculum for what people need to know about what you teach
- Boom, now you have both a product and service that serves as the base of your income.

# Marketing
- You have a brand, content ideas, and offer — but how do you get people to buy it?
	- By understanding human perception.
- If your content or promotions don't capture attention, educate, and nurture that attention, you lose.
- Mastering AND marketing your craft.
	- The principles of content and marketing go hand in hand.

## Content 101:
- Dissect and emulate how your mentors write content
- Practice in the real world, fail, and get better
- Have a blend of step-by-step education, encouragement, and inspiration

## Marketing 101:
- Capture attention
	- Study hooks, headlines, and all social media posts that do well.
	- Use numbers, statistics, pains, and benefits of a topic to open a curiosity loop.
	- Do what works (and will always work) but make it your own.
- Educate and nurture to build authority
	- We are transitioning out of the sleazy direct response marketing age of clickbait funnels and quick cash.
	- You have to be dedicated to dissecting and educating people on the DEPTH behind your interests.
	- This means that you can't only rely on social media to market yourself.
	- You need a quality newsletter that you funnel people into to build authority around what you are selling.
	- That, and other long-form pieces like a lead magnet, podcast, or YouTube will help you sell more.
- Ask them to buy
	- Now that you've established authority with TIME in the game and DEPTH around your interests, ask someone to buy.
	- Target the pains the are experiencing while pursuing their goals and the benefits of the solution you've created.

### Homework for you
- Study:
	- Customer levels of awareness
	- Principles of persuasion and influences
	- Promotion frameworks like AIDA and PASTOR
- If you want to take it even further to practice in a real world setting:
	- Write a promotional tweet, landing page, and email using the AIDA and PASTOR frameworks.
	- Affiliate for a product or software that you already bought (like a website builder or course)
	- Then, practice selling it online by building an audience. Then transition into your own offer.

# Ending
- There are zero excuses or reasons to not be writing content if you want to do what you love.
- The internet has created the potential for everyone to have a small (yet high paying) one-person business.
- It's a matter of treating the internet like real life - display your value.
