# 10 predictors of successful engineering careers
## 1.How an engineer handles grunt work
- Engineers love the latest & greatest tech.
- But the majority of software development is:
	- gluing together APIs
	- refactoring shitty code
	- fixing other people's bugs
- They'll struggle to get to the exciting stuff if they hate the boring.

## 2.How an engineer treats those more junior than them

## 3.How engineers communicate, especially with non-technical people

## 4.An engineer's self-awareness
- Understanding:
	- how one comes off.
	- the impact of one's actions. 
	- the way they treat others and make others feel. 

## 5.How humble they are


## 6.A love for lifelong learning
- Our industry & the world keeps evolving.
- If developers don't love learning, they'll struggle.
- Not learning leads engineers to be stuck in roles or places they hate.

## 7.Knowing what's worth learning
- Learning is important in our industry, but not everything is worth learning.
- Knowing what's worth learning is just as important as learning.


## 8.The risks engineers are willing to take
- Engineers have to make the right tradeoffs, especially on things like tech debt. But tech debt is risky; it could cripple you and your teams.
- But those same risks, if they go right, could have a massive upside for you and your teams.

## 9.Collaboration with other humans

## 10. A focus on others' needs
- Everyone is focused on what they want:
	- Your colleague wants a promotion. 
	- Your Boss wants to grow the team.
- When was the last time you recommended your colleague be promoted?
- When was the last time you told your bosses-boss what your boss needs?

## Bonus: Persevering when it's not looking good
- Don't be demoralized or disengaged when your product is not looking good
