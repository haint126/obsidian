# How To Get Lucky
1. If given 2 equal options, pick the one that has the most luck potential.
2. Introduce People. Networks are the only things that don't divide when you share them - they multiply.
3. Move to the city with the highest chance of luck for you. If you can't physically move, do it digitally.
4. Send DM's to new upcoming people. Build meaningful relationships with people you can grow with. Avoid one-sided fan relationships.
5. Take care of your curiosity like your joints. Assume it's getting worse with age. Age like Gary Vee or Mark Cuban.
6. Get good at marketing. You can export this skill to so many domains. If you can create a persuasive ad, you can copy and paste to your CV, job interview or date.
7. Relax regularly. It's hard to notice lucky opportunities when cortisol is through the roof. Pursue the highest impact relaxation activities.
