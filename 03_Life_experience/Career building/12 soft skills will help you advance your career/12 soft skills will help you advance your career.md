# 1. Communication
- You have to know how to get your points across.
- You also have to know how to truly listen to people.

# 2. Networking
- Your worth is a combination of your skills and networks.
- Start building your network early.
- Don't be transactional in your interactions.
- Instead, play the long game.

# 3. Emotional Intelligence
- Managing your emotions and the emotions of the people around you is crucial.
- People do deals with people they like - Period.
- Low-EQ people often get shut out.

# 4. Leadership
- Managing yourself is hard enough.
- Managing other people is even harder.
- But if you figure it out, you’ll be in the top 5% of workers.
- Put yourself in leadership positions through non-profits, volunteer work, or side hustles.

# 5. Discipline
- Discipline helps you in every part of life.
- Career, health, relationships, and more.
- Think of it like a muscle.
- When you compete with the best, discipline matters.

# 6. Teamwork
- Learn how to work with people, do your part, and contribute in group settings.
- At the end of the day, life is a multiplayer game.

# 7. Adaptability
- “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.” - Mike Tyson
- Being able to adapt to any situation and still get positive outcomes is a key life skill.

# 8. Conflict Resolution
- Conflict is unavoidable, but learning conflict resolution keeps problems small.
- The key is looking at conflict with an open mind, not making it personal, and making resolution your primary goal.
- P.S Avoid doing business with unreasonable humans.

# 9. Empathy
- Empathy is when you can see something from someone else’s perspective.
- Often, it’s the result of simply trying to understand people rather than seeing through just your lens.
- Visualize yourself being that person and be understanding of their feelings.

# 10. Positivity
- I’ve found that, like discipline, positivity is a muscle.
- The more you remind yourself to speak and act in a positive way, the better you get at it.
- Life can be heavy sometimes, and forcing positivity doesn’t always work, but it’s worth training.

# 11. Decisiveness
- One way to train decisiveness is simply making gut decisions quickly, seeing the results, and slowly getting better.
- The other way is researching decision-making frameworks and using them as shortcuts.
- Try both and see what sticks.

# 12. Persuasion
- You need to figure out what people care about and understand how they see the world.
- Communicate your points in a way that resonates with them.
- Studying psychology helps with this.
