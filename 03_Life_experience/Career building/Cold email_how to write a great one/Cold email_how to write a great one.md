# The features of a great cold email:

## Hits the Inbox
- Start by doing some digging on Twitter, LinkedIn, the company website, and Google to see if you can surface a working email address.
	- If you can't find it, make an educated guess
		- [first name] @ [company] . com
		- [first initial][last name] @ [company] . com
		- [first name] . [last name] @ [company] . com
		- [last name] @ [company] . com
	- The data shows those cover >80% of emails—I like those odds!
- You also need the person to open the email.
	- With subject lines, go direct or go creative.
	- There's no perfect subject line. Experiment broadly.
	- A few ideas:
		- [Credentials] looking for perspectives on [goal]
		- [Mutual] said we should connect!
		- Seeking your advice on [goal]

## Short & Sweet
- The person receiving your cold emails probably gets a ton of these.
- Keep it short and sweet.
- Use hard enters to space out text to make it more optically inviting.

## Personalized
- The personal touches can make all the difference.
- Your goal is to make it clear that you didn't send out hundreds of the same note
- A few ideas:
	- Reference a book that you've heard them talk about in the past.
	- Mention a podcast they were on and something you specifically learned from it.
	- Highlight an article you read about them in.

## Social Proof
- Infuse your credentials or some form of social proof—i.e. reasons the person should take you seriously.
- Don't be humble here
	- What have you done or created that is interesting or notable?
	- Who has engaged?

## Create Value
- If you create value for the person you’re emailing, they are much more likely to engage.
- What can you do to save them time or reduce their stress?
- A few ideas:
	- If you're pitching a service, create a mock-up of what you'd do for the person and include a screenshot in the email.
	- If you're trying to get an interview, include a doc breaking down your first 100 days in the role.

## Clear CTA
- Every successful cold email has a very clear call-to-action.
- It has to be specific and succinct.
