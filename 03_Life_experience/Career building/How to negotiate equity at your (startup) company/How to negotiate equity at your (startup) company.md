# Lessons to remember
- Don't wait and hope your company climbs back to previous levels.
- Don't just take the first offer.
- Don't be afraid to ask for information.

# 4 Levers of Startup Compensation

## 1. Cash vs Equity
- Equity is used in startups to attract better talent with bigger upside.
- Cash is guaranteed, and equity is a bet.
- You need to negotiate both.

## 2. Fixed vs Variable
- Fixed = salary
- Variable = equity, performance rewards, etc. (where the real money is made)

## 3. Short-term vs long term
- Short-term: incentives that pay out the year you hit the targets.
- Long-term: incentives that are deferred to pay out in future years (usually in the form of equity, profit share, or rev share)

## 4. Individual vs group
- "I" rewards when you’re solely responsible.
- "We" rewards when compensation is tied to the team or company goals.

# Negotiating startup compensation

## Secure your stock
- If possible, get your stock grant secured at the time of hire, or as fast of a vesting schedule as possible.
- I like to tie mine to performance, not time.
- Prioritize double trigger vesting so you have an out if there's an acquisition.

## Ask about the financials (and cap table)
- It's a bold question, and you might get a no.
- But you are betting on their financial health.
- I'd want to know:
	- Who gets what terms, who is superior to you, and how far down are you in the stack if something goes wrong?

## Research (or meet) the investors
- Meet with investors if possible, and research them if not possible.
- Investors might want to meet top-tier prospective talent.
- For a low-tier job, this will be harder to swing.
	- Look for investors from recognizable VCs, or check the financials.

## Get promises in writing
- If you're already in a startup and your equity is out of money...?
- Ask to realign your incentive pay to compensate for it.
- Examples:
	- Engineer - “If I hit X product milestone by X date, I’d like X in pay.”
	- Sales - “If I hit my quota by X date, I’d like X increase in pay.”
- You know your worth.
- Get it documented.
