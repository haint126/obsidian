# Start with a thank you:
- "Thanks for thinking of me for your {{Ask}}. I really appreciate it and I normally love doing stuff like this."

# Share why you're saying no:
- "Unfortunately, with my {{Project1}}, {{Project2}} and {{Project3}}, I'm at capacity and can't book anything else at the moment."

# Use a cushioned transition:
- "I hope you wonâ€™t take this personally."

# Let them know they aren't alone in getting a no:
- "I field a lot of requests and realize that I need to say no if I hope to make meaningful progress on my these projects."

# Suggest a future date:
- "Please feel free to reach out to me again in 90 days or so, and I might be in a better position to accept."

# Thank them again and wish them luck:
- "Again, thanks for thinking of me. Best of luck with the {{Ask}}, {{FirstName}}."
