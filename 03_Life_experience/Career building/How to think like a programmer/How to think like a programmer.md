# What should you do when you encounter a new problem?

## 1. Understand the problem
- Know exactly what is being asked OR more important what the customer want.
- Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them.

### How to
- You understand a problem when you can explain it in plain English:
	- Write down your problem
	- Doodle a diagram
	- Tell someone else about it
	- Or use a [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)

## 2. Plan the solution
- Don’t dive right into solving without a plan.
- Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

### How to
- To get a good plan, answer this question: “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”
- You can use comment to write down your plan.

## 3. Divide the steps
- **This is the most important step of all**
- Do not try to solve one big problem.

### How to
- Break the problems into sub-problems.
	- These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
- Then, solve each sub-problem one by one.
	- Begin with the simplest.
		- Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).
		- After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.
- Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.
	- Connecting all your _“sub-solutions”_ will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!

### How to 2
- You can reduce the problem into something simpler
- Solve the simpler one
- Then expand the problem slightly then rewrite the solution
- Keep going until you solve the original problem

### Example
> For example, suppose you’re a new programmer and you’re asked to write a program that reads ten numbers and figures out which number is the third highest. For a brand-new programmer, that can be a tough assignment, even though it only requires basic programming syntax.

> If you’re stuck, you should reduce the problem to something simpler. Instead of the third-highest number, what about finding the highest overall? Still too tough? What about finding the largest of just three numbers? Or the larger of two?

> Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match, and keep going until you are back where you started.”
>  — [V. Anton Spraul](http://vantonspraul.com/)

## 4. Stuck?
- What to do when you are stuck, when you can't even solve a sub-problem
- First off, take a deep breath.
- Second, that’s fair.
- Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!
- The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.

### How to
- There are three things to try when facing a whammy:
- Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong.
	- Programmers call this _debugging_ (in fact, this is all a debugger does).

> “The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.”” — Andrew Singer

- Reassess:
	- Take a step back:
		- Get away from your desk, take a walk
			- Sometimes getting fresh air can help you decompress and approach your task with renewed energy.
		- Look at the problem from another perspective
			- Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
	- Another way of reassessing is starting anew.
		- Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes.

> “Sometimes we get so lost in the details of a problem that we overlook general principles that would solve the problem at a more general level. […]

> The classic example of this, of course, is the summation of a long list of consecutive integers, 1 + 2 + 3 + … + n, which a very young Gauss quickly recognized was simply n(n+1)/2, thus avoiding the effort of having to do the addition.” — [C. Jordan Ball](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cjordanball/)

- Research:
	- No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it.
	- Use good old Google to find that person/ solution
	- Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems.
		- Because unless you struggle, you won’t learn anything and wasted your time.

## Practice
- If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

### How to
- You can practice by solving chess puzzles, math problems, Sudoku, Go, Monopoly, video-games, cryptokitties, etc
- Find something that allows you to solve many micro-problems (ideally, something you enjoy).

# Adopting the right mindset
- Be persistent
- Be patient
- Think of a difficult problem as an opportunity to learn and grow
	- Try to enjoy it
- Keep your eye on the big picture, solve the "real" problem

# Growing
- Start as soon as possible
- Break problems into smaller steps
- Review your work
- Use past experience to guide your future work
- Think creatively
- Develop a desire to improve your skills
- Ask for help if you need it
