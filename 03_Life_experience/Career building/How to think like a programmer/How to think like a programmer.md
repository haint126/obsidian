# What should you do when you encounter a new problem?

## 1. Understand the problem
- Know exactly what is being asked OR more important what the customer want.
- Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them.
- You understand a problem when you can explain it in plain English:
	- Write down your problem
	- Doodle a diagram
	- Tell someone else about it
	- Or use a [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)

## 2. Plan the solution
- Don’t dive right into solving without a plan.
- Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.
- To get a good plan, answer this question: “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”
- You can use comment to write down your plan.

## 3. Divide the steps
- Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.
- Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.
- Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
- Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).
- After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.
- Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.
- Connecting all your _“sub-solutions”_ will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!

> For example, suppose you’re a new programmer and you’re asked to write a program that reads ten numbers and figures out which number is the third highest. For a brand-new programmer, that can be a tough assignment, even though it only requires basic programming syntax.

> If you’re stuck, you should reduce the problem to something simpler. Instead of the third-highest number, what about finding the highest overall? Still too tough? What about finding the largest of just three numbers? Or the larger of two?

> Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match, and keep going until you are back where you started.”

## 4. Never give up
- By now, you’re probably sitting there thinking “Hey Richard... That’s cool and all, but what if I’m stuck and can’t even solve a sub-problem??”
- First off, take a deep breath. Second, that’s fair.
- Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!
- The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.
- In fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:
- Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this _debugging_ (in fact, this is all a debugger does).

> “The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.”” — Andrew Singer

- Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?

> “Sometimes we get so lost in the details of a problem that we overlook general principles that would solve the problem at a more general level. […]

> The classic example of this, of course, is the summation of a long list of consecutive integers, 1 + 2 + 3 + … + n, which a very young Gauss quickly recognized was simply n(n+1)/2, thus avoiding the effort of having to do the addition.” — [C. Jordan Ball](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cjordanball/)

Sidenote: Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes. I’m serious. You’ll be dumbfounded at how effective this is.

- Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).

Caveat: Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.

## Practice
Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with insert concept here.”

How to practice? There are options out the wazoo!

Chess puzzles, math problems, Sudoku, Go, Monopoly, video-games, cryptokitties, bla… bla… bla….

So, what you should do is find an outlet to practice. Something that allows you to solve many micro-problems (ideally, something you enjoy).

For example, I enjoy coding challenges. Every day, I try to solve at least one challenge (usually on [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/) ).
