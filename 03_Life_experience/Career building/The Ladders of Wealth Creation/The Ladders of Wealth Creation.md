# Ladder 1: Time for Money

- **The first ladder is trading time for money**. This is how most people you know earn a living. 
- It may start with an hourly job working for Starbucks, but then transition into a salaried position working at a company.
- To climb the ladder to a salaried position you need to specialize in certain skills (design, copywriting, legal, nursing, etc).

## The skills
- The skills for success are simple, but critical:
	1. Show up consistently
	2. Being reliable
	3. Eager to learn

# Ladder 2: A service-based business

- If you choose to make the jump to **the next ladder of running a services business** there's an entirely new set of skills you need to learn that build on the last step…

- This is also where many business owners expand beyond their ability and start to forget the lessons they should have mastered from the previous ladder. 
	- Most often they stop being reliable and showing up consistently.


## The skills
- There are so many things that seem easy now that were daunting to me at the time.
	1. Forming a company
	2. Finding clients
	3. Creating proposals
	4. Pricing services
	5. Hiring employees
	6. Establishing an online presence
	7. Accounting, finance, & operations


# Ladder 3: Productized Services
- Up until now each sale has been made by talking to customers or an employer directly. But to truly reach new levels of income you need to learn a different lesson: 

- **How to make a sale without ever talking to the customer.**

- Productized services mean taking a service (search engine consulting) & bundle it as a set offering at a fixed price (SEO site audit for $1,000).
	- A designer moving from designing sites at $100/hr to charging $2k for a 5 page site.
	- An editor charging $250/video instead of $50/hr

- Because the project scope & price are fixed the provider will make more on some projects than others—but the profits will average out.
- The key lesson is that you gain real leverage through disconnecting time from sales and revenue.

## The skills
- On this ladder we must learn (or hire out):
	1. Writing sales copy that can make a sale without talking to the customer
	2. Designing a sales page (or hiring experts to do it for you)
	3. Processing online payments
	4. Standardizing systems to deliver repeatable quality


# Ladder 4: Selling products

- The goal of a productized service is to remove the manual work from making the sale.
- Selling products continues that trend by also **removing the manual work from delivering the product.**
	- Examples include:
		- A new tripod for vloggers
		- A video course on new cooking techniques
		- An ebook on how to learn a new programming language
		- A software product for realtors
- There’s a huge range in the difficulty of products. Selling an ebook is much easier than launching a social network. 
- The trick is to start with a lower rung on the product ladder & only move up as you’ve learned more skills.

## The skills
- This ladder requires an entirely new set of skills you have to learn in order to sell products in bulk:
	- Customer support at scale
	- Gathering customers at scale
	- Supply chain (for physical product)
	- Fraud prevention
