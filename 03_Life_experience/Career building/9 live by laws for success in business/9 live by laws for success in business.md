# 9 "Live By" Laws For Success In Business
1. The business must be "infinitely" scalable (products, not services).
2. I must own a piece of the upside (not trading hours-for-dollars). 3. My name must be on it, so there's compounding value (no more ghostwriting).
3. Beyond $100k/month in personal income, optimize for other things besides wealth (to avoid diminishing returns on effort relative to outcomes).
4. Stop working with 10% energy in the tank each day (if you push to failure, the following day you will need to rest 3x more).
5. Use social media as a leverage tool for business (not as an identity or a "second reality" you must live in for hours each day).
6. Only read & consume content until you know what you need to do. Then, stop reading & consuming content until what you know you need to do is done (output over everything).
7. Accelerate to failure as fast as you can (you'll either be right, or you'll know now what you need to do instead).
8. Boring, actionable ideas are worth more than shiny, hypothetical ideas (prioritize what you can do well, not what you can do "in theory").
