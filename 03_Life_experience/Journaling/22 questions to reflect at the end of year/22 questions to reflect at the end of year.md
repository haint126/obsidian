# 12. Based on these questions, what do I want to:
- Things to
	- Stop doing in 2023
	- Start doing in 2023

# 16. Love this one from James Clear:
- Imagine your career is a game & ask questions like:

	- What are the rules of the game?
	- How do players advance?
	- How do players lose?
	- Is this game still serving me?

# 17. What are some things I could start doing today that would guarantee an absolutely horrible year?
