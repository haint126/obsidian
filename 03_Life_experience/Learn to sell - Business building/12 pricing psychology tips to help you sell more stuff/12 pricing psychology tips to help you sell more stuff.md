# 1. BIG font = BIG price

# 2. Dollar signs can trigger our “pain of paying”
- Lesson: leaving $ signs off signage can persuade more people to buy as it reduces association with losing money

# 3. Exact numbers appear larger
- $1,302,859.53 seems much bigger than $1.3 M
- Lesson: If you want a number to feel BIG, streeeeeeeeeeetch it out with commas and decimals

# 4. Abbreviated numbers appear smaller
- $12K seems smaller than $12,000.00
- Lesson: If you want a number to feel small (like the price of your services or products) abbreviate it

# 5. High prices anchor our expectations
- Seeing higher priced items near the top of the list creates a price anchor and changes our perception of other items on the list
- Lesson: list higher priced items first to encourage people to spend more

# 6. Numbers in red feel like a bargain
- Studies show that when prices are shown in red, we assume that they’re a great deal
- Red pricing works particularly well for men
- Lesson: show sale prices in red
	- Wanna up the effect? Use smaller fonts for sale prices than the original price

# 7. Numbers that end in .99 seem cheaper
- Psychologically speaking, $9.99 seems smaller than $10
- This is known as “charm pricing” and it’s a staple practice for discount retailers
- Lesson: Use charm pricing to appear cheap

# 8. Odd numbers seem like a better deal than even ones
- In our minds... numbers that end in 5, 7 or 9 appear smaller than ones that end in even number or 0
- So $120 seems more expensive than $117 or $119
- Lesson: end prices with an odd number to appear smaller (without looking cheap)

# 9. Round numbers = more expensive
- Lesson: use round to sell luxury
![[03_Life_experience/Learn to sell - Business building/12 pricing psychology tips to help you sell more stuff/Round number.jpg]]

# 10. Specific numbers anchor our expectations
- If we see “$70 and up” $70 becomes the anchor price
- Snickers grew sales by 38% simply by changing the anchor from ‘them’ to ‘18’
- Lesson: Use specific numbers to encourage people to spend more

# 11. We’ll buy more to get something for $0
- If given the choice between “Buy One Get One Free” or “50% off when you buy 2" the BOGO offer is more compelling
- Lesson: free often beats discounted

# 12. Comparison numbers help us decide
- Lesson: Choose your brand’s comparison set strategically
