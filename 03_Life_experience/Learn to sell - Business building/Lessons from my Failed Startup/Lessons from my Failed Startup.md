I should have been both product-centric and customer-obsessed.
It is better to fail fast than to die slow.

# 1. Kept my startup idea a secret
 - Ideas are free. Words are cheap.
 - Delivering something valuable is hard.
 - Execution is everything.

# 2. Didn’t talk to customers first

# 3. Didn’t listen to the failures of others

# 4. Did the marketing myself
- Working outside of my skill set was a great experience but that wasn’t the goal

# 5. Didn’t manage my time well
- I spent so much time coding
- Had I done better planning up front I probably would have wasted a lot less time building

# 6. Spent way too much time on small details

# 7. Wasted time deliberating stuff that didn’t matter
- My cofounder and I were very different. He is a consultant and I am an engineer.
- We spend too much talking about our disagreements
- => Make sure you find a cofounder you won’t waste time with.

- “Execution-Planning Tradeoff”:
	- There is a 1-to-1 tradeoff between planning and executing 
		- i.e. planning time ~ execution time

# 8. Didn’t allocate capital to the right things
- I should have hired contractors to do most of the things I did myself, especially where the cost was relatively low and the yield was high, like building landing pages, facebook ads, writing articles for content

# 9. Built everything myself

# 10. Misaligned cofounder
- My cofounder and I were too different to be effective together
- If I were to do a startup again in the future, I’d look for a cofounder that compliments me but also aligns with my focus on execution
