- Good marketing relies on a good understanding of your buyers and a *lot* of testing
- Try different setups to find the best fit for your customers

# Anchor
- The first piece of information we get often anchors our expectations
- Look at the ad below
	- “Them” is hard to compare to anything
	- “18” is not—it’s specific and sets a high anchor
- Snickers grew sales by 38% by simply changing one word
