# Finding your team's culture

## 1. Identify Your Mentors
- Bring your team together.
- Ask your team this question:
- “Who are 3 people you admire most (in life, history, or fiction)?”
- Write them down.


## 2. Deconstruct the Admiration
- Now that everyone has the 3 people they admire most, ask the team:
- “What details, traits, and qualities do you admire in each of these 3 people?”
- Encourage your team to get specific.
- Write down the details.


## 3. Connect The Dots
- Once everyone has a few themes for each of their mentors, ask:
- “What are the 3 to 5 commonalities in the details, traits, and qualities you had uncovered?”
- Usually there are around 3 common traits.
- Ask them to write these down.


## 4. Reveal The Truth
- Ask everyone to share the common traits they identified with the group.
- Now, surface the traits that are most consistent across your team.
- Regardless of what might be on your website, THESE are your company’s core values.


## 5. Debrief
- Take a few minutes to discuss the exercise with your team.
- The traits you admire in others are your individual values.
- Our shared values are at the core of our culture.
- We want to keep these values top of mind when making decisions and engaging in day-to-day work.

# 
- Contrary to what you’ve been told, culture isn’t about free snacks and swag.
- It’s about building a connection between a company and employees by:
	1. Identifying what each teammate values
	2. Identifying common values
	3. Encouraging the work by those common values each day
