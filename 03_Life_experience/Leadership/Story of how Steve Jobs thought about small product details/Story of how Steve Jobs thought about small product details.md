# TLDR
- Perfection is poison
- Do not lose track of what is important
- Just because something is good, does not mean it will be a good additional to your product

# How did Steve Jobs react when people told him his ideas were bad?
Steve worked in a tight knit group of close confidants. So the engineers he was meeting often were outside of that circle. He would go from back to back to back meetings with people he had maybe met a couple times before. He needed to figure out whether they knew what they were doing, so would often take an extreme position. If you could argue him in you were probably “ok”, if not, maybe you were a bozo.

I demoed speakers in the first flat panel iMac to him in a lab in IL5 years ago, early in the product development. We prepped two physical models one with forward firing speakers and a grille in the chin, and one with downward firing speakers. I stacked the demo and showed him the good one first. Forward firing. Sounded great. Best sounding iMac ever. Really.

Then I demoed the downward firing speakers.
It sounded crappy, sound comb filtering off the hard surface of a lab bench. Pretty nasty. He winced. Made a comment about the sound. Demo in the bag - I though we were doing the great sounding forward firing speakers.

Some one asked “which model Steve?”

“the last one”

Wait. What!??!?

I blurted out “but you said they sound like crap”.

“They do - your job is to make them sound good enough so customers don’t bring the product back”

Then he did the SJ pure gold move.

“The thing is that anyone who cares about music, will plug in external speakers. And then they will be looking at the product wondering why there is a grille on the front. I want the design to be clean”

We shipped the downward firing speakers.

Steve had a wholistic vision for the entire product. If something was harder to do, but it made the product better, do the hard thing.

He did this thousands of times. He helped people do better work by challenging assumptions and explaining what he wanted.
