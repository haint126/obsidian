# 4 types of feedback
- In 'Radical Candor' book by Kim Scott, he explains 4 types of feedback and how only one of them is effective.
- There are 2 determinants:
	- One, do you care personally about the person you are giving feedback to - whether your friend, your relative, your colleague, whosoever!
	- Second, are you direct with that person or not? Or do you twist and turn or sugar coat your feedback?

## Bottom Right Quadrant:
- If you challenge the person directly, but you do not care for the person - then that is obnoxious aggression!
	- This is when you are harsh, you are rude, you are not being helpful.
- The end result of such an approach is instant defensiveness. With little change in the person we gave the feedback to.

## Bottom Left Quadrant:
- If you do not care about the person but you do not challenge directly either, instead sugar coat and pretend to be all nice and warm - that is manipulative insincerity.
- Most toxic relationships lie here.
- This results in mistrust and again, no change!

## Top Left Quadrant:
- If you do care about the person, but do not challenge directly, it is ruinous empathy.
- It results in ignorance (people do not even know what to fix, if at all to fix anything) and thus no change.
- This is what I was guilty of, for the longest time!

## Top Right Quadrant:
- It is ONLY when you challenge directly AND you care personally about the person you are giving feedback - that it is Radical Candor.
- RC leads to instant change and needless to say, profound in nature!

# 3 questions before giving any feedback
- Before giving any feedback to any of my known ones, I ask these 3 questions:
	- Question 1: Am I saying this because I feel anger or frustration?
	- Question 2: Do I want the other person to truly win, or would I feel happy watching them lose?
	- Question 3: Will this feedback help them or help me?
