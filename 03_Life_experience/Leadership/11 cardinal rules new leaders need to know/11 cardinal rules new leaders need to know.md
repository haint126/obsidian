# 1. Disregard reputations
Everyone has a reputation.

Completely disregard them.

Begin with fresh eyes + clean slates.

Let everyone make their own impression.

# 2. Micromanage (to start)
- Starting out, micromanage your team.
- The catch: this is for YOU, not them.
- Ask people to teach you their jobs.
- Dive into the details with them.
- It shows humility + respect for the work.

# 3. Leverage your ego
- Ego can destroy poor leaders.
- It also can propel the best ones.
- Great leaders don’t deny their ego.
- They leverage it to better the team.

# 4. Use controlled intensity
- Nobody wants an emotional leader.
- But they do want to feel your emotion.
- Think of this as controlled intensity.
- Dial it up + dial it back thoughtfully.
- Never out of control.

# 5. Relationships are your job
- A team is a connected body of people.
- Connection comes from trust.
- Trust comes from relationships.
- Your job is to forge this every day.

# 6. Act with relentless integrity
- What’s integrity?
	- Do the right thing.
	- Do it the right way.
	- Do it at the right time.
- And do that all the time.

# 7. Accept that it’s your fault
- You are accountable for everything.
- Mistakes aren’t “the team’s” fault.
- They are your (the leader’s) fault.
- This is a critical mindset shift.
- Accept it + watch what happens.

# 8. Share in the credit
- Most say “take blame, pass credit.”
- But I say take blame, share in the credit.
- You’re a TEAM— that includes you.
- Honor the team, but don’t deny your role.
- People see through your false humility.

# 9. Believe when nobody does
- Part of a leader’s job is to instill belief.
	- In the mission.
	- In the person.
	- In the team.
- It’s easy when everyone believes.
- It’s hard when others don’t.
- Believe when belief is hard to find.

# 10. Be decisive
- Indecision crushes teams.
- Get feedback + perspective.
- But when it’s time to decide?
- Decide.

# 11. Remember the human
There’s a human behind the professional.

Never forget that.
