# 1. Everything starts with trust
- Your team needs to know you are competent and have integrity. 
- The easiest way to show them you have both is by doing what you say you will do.
	- Write down your commitments
	- Proactively manage expectations


# 2. Conflict is a Constant

- Hoping conflict will go away by ignoring it is like hoping weeds in your garden will go away when you ignore them. 

- Your goal is not to hope conflict disappears because it won't. Your goal is to get better at managing it.


# 3. Seeds Depend on Soil

- You can create healthy soil in your organization by listening deeply to people at all levels.

- Understanding their goals and obstacles will ensure you can provide the support they need.

- Creating healthy soil will allow ideas to flourish.
