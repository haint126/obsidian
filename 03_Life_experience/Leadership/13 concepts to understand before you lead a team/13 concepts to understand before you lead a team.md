# 1. Everything starts with trust
- Your team needs to know you are competent and have integrity. 
- The easiest way to show them you have both is by doing what you say you will do.
	- Write down your commitments
	- Proactively manage expectations

# 2. Conflict is a Constant, don't ignore it
- Hoping conflict will go away by ignoring it is like hoping weeds in your garden will go away when you ignore them. 
- Your goal is not to hope conflict disappears because it won't. Your goal is to get better at managing it.

# 3. Understand each member's goals and obstacles
- You can create healthy soil in your organization by listening deeply to people at all levels.
- Understanding their goals and obstacles will ensure you can provide the support they need.
- Creating healthy soil will allow ideas to flourish.

# 4. Keep the vision visible
- Be ruthless about making sure all levels of your organization understand their priorities and Why their work matters. 
- Great leaders keep the vision visible.

# 5. Recognize their Strengths
- The things that are recognized get repeated. Make sure your team recognizes the value they bring.
- Your team will be more engaged and more likely to stay when they have a manager who focuses on their strengths.

# 6. Develop a Coaching Culture
- When you spend time developing your people, you save time fixing unnecessary problems. 
- Plus:
	- More collaboration 
	- Better performance

# 7. Know Your Strengths and Weakness
- You canâ€™t be good at everything. Develop a partnership with people who complement your strengths and cover your weakness
- Side note: these are likely people you initially have a conflict with.

#  8. Invest in Yourself
- As you gain influence, working on yourself has a multiplying impact. 
- Improving your leadership skills will allow you to be more effective in improving the lives around you. 

# 9. Be Urgent With Feedback
- Don't wait 10 days for a conversation that will take 10 minutes.
- Remember, the purpose of feedback is to help.
- Be direct with feedback because you are invested in the success of others.

# 10. Empower Decision Makers
- Make sure your team understands the big picture and give them guard rails to work within. 
- When obstacles come up, you want them to be able to tell you why they made adjustments instead of coming to you for approval.

# 11. Make it Easy to Talk About Mistakes 
- People are going to make mistakes. When this happens it's important for you to respond in a way that is aligned with your goals and values.
- Creating a culture where people hide mistakes is expensive.

# 12. Follow the 80/20 Rule
- You need to know what 20% of your actions lead to 80% of your results.
- Knowing this will make it much easier for you to say NO to the things not setting your team up for success.

# 13. Protect Your Refresh Time
- Know the things that keep you at your best, and don't let them become optional. 
- When you fail to stay energized, your team will feel it first.

# 14. Self-Awareness is the First Brick
- The most important lesson for leaders is Self-Awareness.
- Know when you are at your best. 
- And know when you need to ask for help.
- Humility and growth are impossible without awareness.
