# 1. Lead From the Front
- Most "leaders" are actually bosses.
	- They see leadership as "telling" people what to do.
	- But this quickly creates a toxic culture of:
		- Slow feedback loops
		- Shaky operations
		- Resentment
		- Poor results
- Great leaders dictate the tempo:
	- They lead by example—bringing more volume & intensity than anyone else.
	- This forces the rest of the team to rise to meet that level of energy (or get left behind).
- The result are tremendous output.

- Which brings us to the 2nd principle:

# 2. Preach the Score Takes Care of Itself
- Poor leaders fixate on outcomes.
	- The stock price
	- The sales number
	- The user milestone
- But great leaders understand:
	- Outcomes are not a result—they are a byproduct.
- So instead of obsessing over short-term metrics, they do this:
	- They stress the importance of:
		- Inputs
		- Details
		- Process
	- They don't focus on results.
	- They focus on building the system that makes results inevitable.
- And the key to building that system?
	- The 3rd principle:

# 3. Take Extreme Ownership
- Great leaders understand everything that happens in their organization is 100% their responsibility.
	- No blaming
	- No complaining
	- No defending
- Nothing is "beneath" them.
- Instead, they realize everything is their fault—and they act this way:

# 4. Reinforce Tight Feedback Loops
- "Power is the speed at which you can go from idea to execution"—Alex Hormozi
- So the most powerful person would be someone who:
	- Thinks about something
	- It instantly appears in the real world
- Which makes this the goal of the organization:
- Most companies have slow feedback loops.
	- They begin working on something, then "circle back" at the end of the week.
	- Instead, make the default the end of the day (or hour!).
	- You'll get 7x more done than everyone else (at least).
- To implement this, you need the 5th principle:

# 5. Deliver Radical Candor
- Poor communication kills culture.
- And most organizations communicate with one of these two:
	1. No sincerity & tons of gossip
	2. Brutal honesty & complete lack of empathy

- Both of these are recipes for long-term disaster.
- Kim Scott defines Radical Candor as striking the balance between:
	- Caring personally
	- Challenging directly
- The leader who communicates well strikes the perfect mix of:
	- Honesty
	- Empathy
	- Directness
- How to develop this?
	- Our 6th principle will help.

# 6. Overcommunicate. Overcommunicate. Overcommunicate.
- Most "leaders" expect their team to be mind readers.
	- Vague instructions
	- Unclear decision-making rules
- Then, like clockwork, something is done incorrectly.
- The "leader":
	1. Blames the other person
	2. Complains about their incompetence

- The "leader" lack of Extreme Ownership & Radical Candor.
- Then the vicious cycle continues.
- Instead, communicate expectations clearly, concisely, & repeatedly.
- Otherwise, our 7th & last principle is impossible:

# 7. Expect Competitive Greatness
- The combination of these first 6 principles will create a culture of:
	- Positive-sum collaboration
	- Efficient communication
	- Operational excellence
	- Rapid iteration loops
- The result?
	- Winning.

# Bonus:
- Remain humble and always praise others vs. taking credit.
