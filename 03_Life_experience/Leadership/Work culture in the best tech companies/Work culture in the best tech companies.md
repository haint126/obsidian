# TLDR

- To succeed in tech, you need to switch from a corporate culture of top-down control to a culture of bottom-up empowerment


# Work culture in the best tech companies

- The only real play in the software industry is to find the best talent and empower it to build things. It's a creative industry. The work culture of the best tech companies is what it is because it has evolved around this fact (though some of them sometimes lose their way).
- Sometimes, folks who come from corporate cultures that haven't understood this fact (and whose tech sectors are badly lagging behind as a result) show up at SV companies and are like, wait, where are the bosses? Why is everyone unsupervised, eating snacks and listening to music?
- Well, this is why. If you want to succeed in tech you need to switch from a corporate culture of top-down control (the usual standard) to a culture of bottom-up empowerment. And you need to *value talent*. Talent cannot be thought of as an expendable, replaceable resource.


- Without a leader, team might have no clear goal and get lost
- The best leaders also do a fantastic job articulating what the hard problems are, and then let their talent figure out how to solve them.
