# TLDR
- People's biggest frustration is time wasting
- Good time is which people **effectively** spend doing their specialty
- Bad time is which people spend inefficiently or doing work their are not hired for
- How to find bad time:
	- Each person track work in 30 min segments
	- Mark each segment as good or bad time
	- Write down why the segment is bad time
- How to fix:
	- Eliminate
	- Automate
	- Consolidate

# The biggest frustration
- What do people value more than anything?
	- Their time.
- So the root of most people's frustration?
	- Wasting it.
- And most companies are black belt time wasters.

# Good Time vs. Bad Time
- What is Good Time?
	- That's the craft your people were hired to do
	- Executed excellently w/o waste
- What's Bad Time?
	- Overhead, administration, bureaucracy
	- Inefficient drag on Good Time work

## How to find your team's good time and bad time
- Pick one day (you don't need more)
- Have your team track their work in 30 min segments
- Have them classify every segment as Good or Bad Time
- If Bad Time, have them briefly note Why
- Calculate % Good Time (this is your baseline)

# How to fix
- Most high-performing teams are 80% Good Time.
- Few teams are high-performing by this definition.
- So now you need two vectors to attack the waste:
	- Individual: What's one thing each person can fix from their list?
	- Team: What's one theme you can fix as the leader?

## The Most Common Levers to Kill Bad Time
- Eliminate
	- Remove low-value tasks
	- Outdated processes
	- Unnecessary meetings.
- Automate
	- Use tools and software for high-repetition, low-judgment tasks.
- Consolidate
	- Redraw smarter boundaries
	- Create more logical groupings.

## Tactics to Making This Take Hold:
- Track the data.
- Celebrate the wins.
- Diagnose the misses.
- Don't let waste sneak in.
- Make the review a team ritual.
- Most importantly: Don't overcomplicate it.
	- You don't want this process to become Bad Time too.
