1. It’s not real if it’s not written down.
2. Decisions have tradeoffs you make.
	- Indecision has consequences you bear.
3. When it comes to motivating teams, good questions always beat great answers.
4. A responsibility shared by many is a responsibility owned by no one.

11. Your team will mimic your actions before they follow your words.
12. Ethical dilemmas will arise. Imagine yourself being deposed under oath. Which path will you proudly defend? Take that one.

	- Tension, so they can’t be gamed.
19. The ceiling for good talent using a shared system is much higher than great talent operating with no system.
20. Compare your ideal state to your current state to uncover the highest leverage problems.
21. If you don't take the time to ask Why something hit you urgently, don't be surprised when it happens again tomorrow.
