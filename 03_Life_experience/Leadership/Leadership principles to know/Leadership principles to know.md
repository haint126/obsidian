# Leadership principles
- You can be great at business,
- But terrible at leading.
- Harsh truth: No one cares about your business as much as you do.
- The best leaders fire themselves from as many roles as possible.
- Track team and individual KPIs. If you can't tell who is in charge, no one is.
- Do everything you can to decrease meetings.
	- 1 hour x 16 employees = 2 days lost
- NEED a meeting? Use an agenda structure. Constantly improve it.

- No one should ever be surprised when you fire them.
- Firing should mean encouraging them to do the thing they actually should do.
- Micromanaging means you hired wrong.
- Poor performance isn’t your employee’s problem. It’s yours.
- Hiring for the right values is the antidote to micromanagement.
- By yourself, you will never scale.
- Two words to turn a SMB into a big player:
	- Decentralized
	- Leadership.
- You’re never too good for a mentor.
- Keep 3 mentors:
	- The billionaire to your millionaire
	- A peer you can learn with
	- An up-and-comer with hustle.
- Be willing to repeat yourself. In fact, count on it.
- Underrated quality of good leaders:
	- You leave a meeting with them more energized.
- Underrated quality of awful leaders:
	- They try to please everyone and lead by committee.
- You invest in people, not companies.
- My best investments have been companies with a great leader.
	- Worst have had terrible ones
- Want to gain influence and respect?
	1. Admit when you f-ed up.
	2. Give credit/kudos freely & often.
