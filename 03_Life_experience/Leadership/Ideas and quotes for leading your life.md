# How great leaders inspire action | Simon Sinek | TED

**TLDR: People do things for themselves, so instead of making people think what you think, make people believe what you believe**

- Explain what we do from: Why -> How -> What
- Our brain has 2 sections
	- One for reasoning, language and rational = What
	- Others for feeling (trust, loyalty), behavior, decision making (but not language) = Why + How
	- => Talk from Why and How to affect others feeling, decision making
- Hire people believe what you believe
- Mass market acceptance of an idea is achieved by breaking the tipping point of 15% and the rest on the law of diffusion of innovation map
	- Mass majority will not try something until someone has tried it first
- Rather than making people do things for you, making them do things for themselves by making them believe in what you believe
- Those who lead inspire us
- We follow those who lead not for them but for ourselves
