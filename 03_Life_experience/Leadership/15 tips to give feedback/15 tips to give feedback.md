# If you've ever dreaded giving feedback, these 15 sentences are for you:
1. Effective feedback is a gift, not an insult.
2. Aim your feedback at the action or work, not at the person.
3. Explain your perception of the action without accusing - this keeps you out of right vs wrong.
4. Praise in public, but give feedback in private - create the conditions for them to hear what you have to say.
5. Effective feedback is emphatic and clear: no need to be a jerk, but don't swerve around either.
6. Feedback contributes to a behavioral change or growth, it's not a time & place to unload.
7. You can only give feedback if expectations were clear upfront.
8. Give genuine positive feedback frequently to normalize feedback and practice your delivery.
9. Effective feedback builds a culture of trust, transparency, and growth within your team.
10. Never give feedback in the moment: note it, retreat, calm down, forgive & prepare.
11. Remove ambiguity by using a specific example, don't come with a vague & general observation.
12. Show the other person why they should care by linking your feedback to their goals.
13. Effective feedback is timely: if you wait too long, the window for reflection & change has closed.
14. Teaching someone a lesson takes away ownership, make a request for a change instead.
15. The goal of giving effective feedback is not to send, but to be heard. Read that again.
16. Effective feedback provides someone with an opportunity. If you frame it as such, they, you, and your relationship will grow stronger. Don't dread it!
