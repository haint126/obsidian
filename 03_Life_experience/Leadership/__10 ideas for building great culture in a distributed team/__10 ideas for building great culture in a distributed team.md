# 0.
- Don't let anyone tell you company culture is defined by free lunches and ping pong tables.
- It's a culture of trust, clear feedback, focused work, meaningful connection, and a shared mission.

# 1. Create a private team stories podcast.
- Everyone has the same get to know you conversations starting from zero. Instead interview them about their life story for a private internal podcast. 
- The whole team can listen and get a head start on building relationships.

# 2. Build a culture of written, asynchronous communication
- This will save so many meetings, avoid people feeling left out if they weren't in the meeting, and protect focused work.
- Your team will also be forced to clearly articulate and refine their ideas.

# 3. Shared “no meeting” days.
- Everyone has the same day for focused work each week. Team members can have days that they don’t need to get camera ready (e.g. hair, make-up, etc) if they don’t want to.
- At ConvertKit, we do Tuesdays and Fridays, which are wildly productive.

# 4. Ask "What did you get into this weekend?"
- Every Monday morning we have a bot that posts to Slack asking people to share a photo (or a few) from the weekend. It's a great way to get to know co-workers on a personal level and see their families, interests, and lives.

# 5. Create an automated email sequence for new team members
- Explain how you work, where to find important things (like the joke slack channels), fun facts about team members, explain inside jokes, & more.
- It's all automated so you can curate their first 30+ days at the company.

# 6. Host "unsolicited feedback" sessions
- This is where a small team (usually 4-8 people) gathers to talk about someone in the hot seat as if they aren't there for 10 min. When it's your turn all you can do is sit & take notes, then you get 5 min to respond.
- Here are the prompts:
	- What does this person do that you find remarkable? What do you brag about them to other people?
	- If they were up for the promotion of their career in 6 months, what would you tell them now to give them the best chance of getting it?
	- Assume you're working with this person for the next 10 years. What behavior isn't a big deal now, but will get really annoying or frustrating over that time?
- This results in the best compliments, the most constructive feedback, and a culture of direct, candid conversations.

# 7. Mandatory fun days
- With teams feeling burnt out force everyone to take the same day off. That means you don't have to come back to a mountain of slack messages and emails. 
- Come back & share a photo. 
- We did a 3-day weekend for the last 3 months of the year.

# 8. Schedule S'Ups
- We use a bot to pick 3 people at random each week for a 30 min catch up / get to know you call.
- A triad means you always get a dynamic group from a cross section of the team. This builds relationships and breaks silos across product, eng, ops, growth, etc

# 9. Host retreats 2x a year
- Regularly gathering your team in person is one of the most important things you can do. 2x a year ended up being the perfect cadence for us. 
- We split our time: 33% work & strategy, 33% personal connection, and 33% downtime & fun.
- The biggest mistake I see companies make is trying to get too much work done on a retreat.
- Connections get accelerate so much through great memories and shared experiences. 
- You can have everyone record footage for a vlog to let the memories carry through to the next retreat.

# 10. Donate money together
- At a team retreat we divided our team into groups of 4 with one goal: give away $10,000 in $100 at a time.
- With 50 people on the team that meant each group had to find about 12 charities to support. Then we regrouped to share who we donated to & why.
- What followed were the best stories that made for connection points: 
	- Someone donated to education grants because they were first in their family to go to college.
	- Cancer research because they'd lost a loved one.
	- Pet rescue because that's where they'd found a best friend.
- $100 isn't that much, so it would be fair to argue the money would be better donated to a single charity, but our main goal was life stories and points of connection.
- Give it a try with your team. You'll all get a peek into what your coworkers value & why.
