# Make their goals your goals

>“Talk to someone about themselves and they’ll listen for hours.”
―Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People

- Tell them that you want to help them and while helping them, you need their help

# Charge your trust battery

- Build trust and ask for returns when needed

# Help them see what you see

- Don't rush people into quick decision
- Instead, take time to make sure the other person truly sees what you see, and understand why this is the correct path

> “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.” —Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
