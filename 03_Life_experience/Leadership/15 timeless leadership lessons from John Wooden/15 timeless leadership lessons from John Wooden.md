# 1. Big talkers and little doers
- Don’t tell people what you can do.
- Instead, show them what you can do.
	- Too many people are “big talkers” and “littler doers.”
	- If you want to be your best, be the opposite.

# 2. Your Ford vs. their Chevy
- You’re building a Ford. Don’t compare it to someone else’s Chevy.
	- All you can do is build the best Ford possible.
	- Comparison impedes competency.
- Focus all your time and attention on building your best “Ford”
	- And be proud of that effort.

# 3. How to change the world
- If you want to make a difference in the world, start by changing yourself.
	- Many people say they want to “change the world.”
- The best way to do good is to be good.
	- Good role models are difference-makers.

# 4. Character creates longevity
- Ability may get you to the top of your field, but character is required to stay there.
	- It’s easy to relax after reaching a goal.
	- Avoid this complacency at all costs.
- Have the self-discipline to stay the course.

# 5. Learn forever, die tomorrow
- Learn like you’ll live forever, seeking wisdom each day.
- Live as if you’ll die tomorrow, relishing every minute of your life and taking nothing for granted.

# 6. Preparation is the prize
- Satisfaction comes from preparation, not an outcome.
	- The process is the prize, not a score or trophy.
- Prepare well and execute to the best of your ability — that’s all you control.

# 7. Failures vs. mistakes
- Failures are different from mistakes.
	- Mistakes are mishaps you make along the path of doing something.
	- Failure is not giving your full effort.
- Only you can judge if you failed. You can fool everyone else.

# 8. The infection of success
- Your past doesn’t guarantee your future.
	- Some people believe success just repeats itself, but that’s not true.
	- If you believe this, you are “infected” with success.
- Success must be continuously earned.
- Learn from the past, don’t live in it.

# 9. Never live in hindsight
- Look back to learn, not to dwell.
	- Second guessing is wasted effort.
- Your decisions won’t always work out — that’s life.
	- Complaining about it wastes your time.
	- Complaining to others wastes their time.

# 10. Be a realistic optimist
- Your goals should be difficult but attainable.
	- Easy goals give little personal satisfaction.
	- Idealistic goals end up discouraging people.
- The balance is being a realistic optimist.
- Set difficult goals still within reach.

# 11. Winners make the most mistakes
- Mistakes come from doing things.
- Success also comes from doing things.
- If you want to live mistake-free, do nothing.
- If you want to win, go out and make mistakes.

# 12. Learn the trade, not the tricks
- Some people chase “tricks of the trade.”
	- If you spend all your time doing this, you’ll never master the trade itself.
- If you’re looking for a shortcut, there isn’t one.
	- Shortcuts may work for a while, but not for long.

# 13. Failure to change is fatal
- Failure to change is stubbornness.
	- It comes from an unwillingness to learn.
- There cannot be progress without change.
- One failure probably won’t be fatal, but failure to realize you must evolve will be.

# 14. Determine your own final score
- You determine the “final score.”
	- Not some arbitrary scoreboard.
- Focus on improving not comparing
	- Then accept the results that come after that.

# 15. The guaranteed dividend
- Hard work pays dividends.
	- The dividend is not outscoring an opponent.
	- The dividend is knowing you did everything you could to bring forth your potential.
		- This is the only dividend in life that’s guaranteed.
