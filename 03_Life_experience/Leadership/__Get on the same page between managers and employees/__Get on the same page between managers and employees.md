# For managers
- Setting expectations is your only job.
- If your team doesn't know what you expect, you're failing them
- There can only be three causes:
	- You're not managing your boss well
	- You're incapable of making a decision
	- You're hoping people will read your mind

## To manage up:
- Action:
	- Have a dashboard of agreed goals + progress
	- Also, know your team's capacity/utilization
	- When your boss asks for more, be clear on what drops
- You're a manager, not a magician.

## To make a decision:
- Action:
	- If it fits your goals & capacity do it
	- If it's easily undone make a call
	- If it's ambiguous run a test
	- If it could ruin you get help
- 99% of your fears are bigger in your mind than reality.

## To make expectations explicit:
- Action:
	- Agree on the What & When (SMART or OKRs both work)
	- Agree on How (process, tech, budget, culture all matter)
	- Agree on Changes & Experiments (calculated innovation)
- Have them send you an email summarizing.

## Two more tips:
- Co-author
	- Your people are more likely to stick to the script they wrote.
- Consistency
	- Expectations are imperfect, so they'll need feedback.
	- Agree upfront how and when this will happen.

# For employees
- If you don't know your expectations, there are two possible causes:
	- You're lazy
	- You're afraid

## I'm not lazy:
- If the map of explicit expectations above makes sense, why haven't you written it?
- You're either:
	- Passively waiting to be directed
	- Unclear on what needs to be done
- => Either way, drafting your expectations and discussing them with your manager is progress.

## I'm not afraid:
- How can you win a game if you don't know the rules?
- So you're either:
	- Afraid to ask your manager
	- Afraid to escalate that your manager is lost
	- Afraid to leave despite being grossly mismanaged
- It's your career. Play to win. Don't play not to lose.

## Two more tips for employees:
- Synthesize
	- Focus on the big picture, not every detail
	- You create more value if you can connect the dots
- Empathize
	- Your manager will not have every answer
	- You can help them by surfacing the right questions
