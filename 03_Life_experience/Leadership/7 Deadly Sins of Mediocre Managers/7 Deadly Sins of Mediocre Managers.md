# TLDR
1. Give your team specific approaches and goals
2. Delegate your work
3. Build trust even with your friends
4. Provide clarity of your words and actions
5. Act decisively
	- Be clear between "Debate" and "Decide"
6. Set high goals for each member and let them be their own critic
7. Help people grow (more than they can do on their own)

# 1/ Don't set expectations
- You probably did the job you now manage.
	- You take for granted the 100 lessons you learned through time.
- Make them guess what you want?
	- Your habits become someone else's heartache.
- Tip: Align on expectations for Goals (the what) & Approach (the how)

# 2/ Don't delegate
- You keep your old work.
	- But now you have a new role too.
	- 4 tasks pile on for every 1 you finish.
- Meanwhile, your team waits.
	- Patiently at first. Then vocally. Then with their feet.
- Tip: Delegate faster than feels comfortable.

# 3/ Don't build trust
- Illusion: Believing you start with trust
- Reality: No trust Day 1, not even your old friends\
- And w/o trust, small things (gestures, comments) have big impacts.
- And big things (critical feedback) crushing.
- Tip: Lead with questions. Meet your commitments.

# 4/ Don't provide clarity
- Guess matters?
	- Your words
	- Your habits
	- Your actions
	- Your priorities
	- Your decisions
	- Your indecisions
- Yes, your words matter.
- But what you do (and even what you don't do) matters more.
- Tip: Slow is smooth & smooth is fast.

# 5/ Don't act decisively
- Should you lead with questions and humility?
	- 100% Yes.
- Should you gather data and seek smart triangulation?
	- Also wise.
- But then you need to convert those inputs into a decision.
- Tip: Be clear which mode you're in -> "Debate" vs "Decide"

# 6/ Don't hold people accountable
- The magic formula for high-performing teams:
	- Set ambitiously high standards
	- Hire extremely talented people
	- Believe they'll achieve them
	- Challenge them directly
- Tip: Ask them first. A-players are their own harshest critics.

# 7/ Don't help people outgrow them
- Leaders know they're only as good as the people they're leading.
- If you cap their upside, you'll only attract talent willing to settle.
- Humble & Hungry >> Accepting & Average
- Tip: Build a brand as a talent accelerant. Stars will come to you.
