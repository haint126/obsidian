# 0. TLDR
- Frequently zoom in and zoom out:
	- 3 month goals for focus
	- 1-5 year goal for the big picture
- Balance optimistic and realistic
	- Why there are reasons to be excited
	- What’s the reality ahead
- Trust but verify
	- Give trust only if you can verify their progress
	- Step in when things get off-track
- Measure everything
	- Having the hard conversations UP-FRONT to define a measurable metric
- Demand all-in, in a healthy way
	- A great team is all-in but healthy & sustainable.
- Tolerate honest mistakes, not sloppiness
- Feed your eagles, starve your turkeys
	- Pay more attention to your high performer
	- Ignore mediocre performers who demand a lot of attention
- End the perfectionist
	- Perfectionists devalue time - the most important asset
	- The 80/20 rule
- Give your reports your cell phone number
	- So people can reach you whenever they need
- Celebrate the big wins
	- Celebrate at the right time to keep your team’s soul, and your momentum, alive.

# 1. Zoom out, zoom in
- Sit down with your team.
	- Ask “where do we want to be in 5yrs?”
	- Then “where do we need to be in 1yr to get there?”
	- Then “where do we need to be in 3mo to get there?”
- Write all those down somewhere your team can easily access.
	- Refer back, constantly.
- Do both: zoom out, zoom in, again, and again.
	- If you just refer to 3mo goals, the team loses the bigger picture.
	- If you just refer to 1-5yr vision, the team loses focus.

# 2. Be both the optimist and the realist
- Optimism is the lifeblood of an organization.
	- Your team joined your company to build something great; and it’s gotta be fun.
- In management, positivity is a superpower.
- But too much positivity can can easily detach your team from reality.
	- -Missed goals and lost trust.
- The best managers can simultaneously remind the team:
	- A/ Why there’s reason to be excited and
	- B/ The reality of what’s ahead

# 3. Trust but verify
- Trust is important, but it must be earned over the long-run.
- Some of my biggest mistakes have been when I’ve given out unearned trust too quickly.
- Only giving trust early if you can **verify**:
	- Follow their progress
	- Figure out a mechanism to know if things are on-track
- So that when things get off-track, you can:
	- Step in
	- Course-correct
	- Make sure you don't miss goals.

# 4. Measure everything
- If it’s not measurable, it won't happen.
- Soft dates, vague descriptions, hand-wavy metrics never work.
- The only way you can consistently expect results is having the hard conversations UP-FRONT.
	- What are you going to deliver?
	- By when?
	- How can we measure that you’ve delivered?
	- How can we measure that this is generating impact for the company?
	- etc.

# 5. Demand all-in, in a healthy way
- There are two pitfalls in management:
	- a) You have a team that is not all-in.
	- b) You have a team that is so all-in that they burnout.
- Expect 100% commitment.
	- Not 90%: that means they’re not giving it their all.
	- Not 110%: this means they’ll burn out and eventually become unhealthy.
- Talk just as much about health as you do about commitment.
- **A great team is all-in but healthy & sustainable.**

# 6. Tolerate honest mistakes, not sloppiness
- Good people trying their best are going to make mistakes.
	- When that happens, show them grace.
- When people are sloppy, it’s another story.
	- Work can’t be sloppy.
	- Lower the bar, and the company suffers.
		- They’ll start to think that sloppy work is acceptable

# 7. Feed your eagles, starve your turkeys
- Here’s the thing:
	- Bad performers are easy to find out.
	- But your bigger risk is mediocre performers who demand a lot of attention.
- It’s way too common to feed your turkeys.
- Instead, feed your EAGLES.
	- They’re the ones moving the needle.
- You think you’re being nice, but it demotivates your A players, and it hurts your company.
- I adopted a rule:
	- Paying attention to a report = Performance
	- Performance = delivering on goals + fostering team culture

# 8. End the perfectionist
- Speed, momentum, progress, results drive your business.
- But perfect is the enemy of all these drivers.
- Perfectionists want the end product to be perfect, and use this to devalue time which is your most important asset.
- However, some teams should be allowed to sacrifice some speed for perfect.
	- Press statements
	- Financials
	- Legal
	- Critical software infrastructure

# 9. Give your reports your cell phone number
- Isn’t good management regular meetings? Written reporting? Structure?
- The problem: what if someone gets stuck.
- Needing to wait until the next meeting to get unstuck can cost critical time. If it's important, my team can call me any time.

# 10. Celebrate the big wins
- Some say celebrate the small wins; I say keep working and celebrate the BIG ones.
- Celebration is core to human societies for good reason.
- Do it at the right time to keep your team’s soul, and your momentum, alive.
- Do it for them... AND for you
