# The Practice of Groundedness
- Lessons:
	- Learn the 6 principles of sustainable excellence
	- How to perform at a high-level w/o burning out
	- How to be consistent
- 9 key themes Groundedness will teach you:
	1. Outcomes matter but you've got to enjoy the process if you are to have longevity.
	2. Consistency is way more valuable than intensity
	3. How you perform on your average days is more important than how you perform on your great ones.
	4. After big wins or devastating defeats, the medicine is the sameâ€”getting back to doing the work itself.
	5. Become a master of showing up.
	6. You don't have to like failure, but you've got to be okay with it.
	7. Take the work extremely seriously, but yourself not so much.
	8. Community is everything. Nobody reaches the top alone. The people around you shape you. Surround yourself wisely.
	9. Stress + rest = growth. Figuring out the appropriate dose of each is key, and a moving target.
