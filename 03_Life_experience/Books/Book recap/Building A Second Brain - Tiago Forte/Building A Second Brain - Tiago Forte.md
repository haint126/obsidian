# TLDR
- When you put your idea into concrete form, you can freely examine them and make them better
- Information becomes personal knowledge only when we put it to use
- Notetaking is like sending packets of knowledge to your future self.
- Every time you take a note, ask yourself, 'How can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?'
- You can't wait until everything is perfect.
- The sooner you begin, the sooner you start on the path of improvement.
- With the PARA system, every piece of information you want to save can be placed into one of just four categories:
	- Projects:
		- Short-term efforts in your work or life that you are working on now
	- Areas:
		- Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time
	- Resources:
		- Topics or interests that may be useful in the future
	- Archives:
		- Inactive items from the other three categories

# Recap
- Your professional success and quality of life depend directly on your ability to manage information effectively.
- Before we do anything with our ideas, we have to 'off-load' them from our minds and put them into concrete form. Only when we declutter our brain of complex ideas can we think clearly and start to work with those ideas effectively.
- Once our thoughts are outside our head, we can examine them, play with them, and make them better. It's like a shortcut to realizing the full potential of the thoughts driving through our minds.
- Information becomes knowledge–personal, embodied, verified–only when we put it to use. You gain confidence in what you know only when you know that it works.
- Every time you take a note, ask yourself, 'How can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?' That question will lead you to annotate the words and phrases that explain why you saved a note, what you were thinking, and what exactly caught your attention.
- You are what you consume, and that applies just as much to information as to nutrition.
- With the PARA system, every piece of information you want to save can be placed into one of just four categories:
	- Projects:
		- Short-term efforts in your work or life that you are working on now
	- Areas:
		- Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time
	- Resources:
		- Topics or interests that may be useful in the future
	- Archives:
		- Inactive items from the other three categories
- Notetaking is like time travel–you are sending packets of knowledge through time to your future self.
- Waiting until you have everything ready before getting started is like sitting in your car and waiting to leave your driveway until all the traffic lights across town are green at the same time. You can't wait until everything is perfect.
- The true test of whether a piece of knowledge is valuable is not whether it is perfectly organized and neatly labeled, but whether it can have an impact on someone or something that matters to you.
- I can't think of anything more important for your creative life–and your life in general–than learning to listen to the voice of intuition inside.
- The sooner you begin, the sooner you start on the path of improvement.
