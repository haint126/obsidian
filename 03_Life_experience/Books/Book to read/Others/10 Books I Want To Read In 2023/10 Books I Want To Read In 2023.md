# 10 Books I Want To Read In 2023
1. Dopamine Nation.
	- I want to better understand this neurotransmitter and how it basically rules our life.
2. Lean Thinking.
	- I want to study the art of the Toyota Production System & apply it to my business. And based on others' recommendations, this book is the best place to start.
3. Amazon Unbound.
	- This is the most up-to-date account of Jeff Bezos & Amazon, a nice sequel to The Everything Store.
4. Eat Mor Chikin.
	- The business of Chick-Fil-A fascinates me. I want to learn more about their origin story & how they operate.
5. The Starbucks Experience.
	- Similar to Chick-Fil-A, I want to study the business of Starbucks & how they operate as well.
6. Mastery.
	- I first read this book 4 years ago and it greatly impacted me. Now, I want to reread it to see how I can apply its principles to the next step in my journey.
7. How To Win Friends And Influence People.
	- Again, this book has a profound impact on me 4 years ago, so I want to revisit it and see how I interpret things differently now.
8. Atomic Habits.
	- And last but not least, I want to revisit the fundamentals of behavior change & habit formation, once again seeing how I interpret this book differently years later.
9. Ready Player One.
	- For years I've wanted to read more fiction before bed, but I've never stuck with it. But I picked this book up over the weekend and the first 20 pages hooked me!
10. Against the Odds: An Autobiography.
	- This is the book that David Senra, host of the Founder's Podcast, most recommends to entrepreneurs-and I trust his judgment!
