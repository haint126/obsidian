# 3 techniques to hook your audience

## 1. Start in the middle of the action
- This does 2 things:
	- Creates forward momentum with physical action
	- Creates questions about the cause of action in your audienceâ€™s mind
- Lesson:
	- Backstory can come later in the story.
	- Opening with action creates instant momentum.

## 2. Start with the end
- This tactic makes the audience wonder how they get to the end.
- It creates a sense of mystery, a need to fill in the gap in the story.
- Lesson:
	- Use your opening to create a curiosity gap that your audience wants filled.

## 3. Create an emotional connection
- Lesson: If you emotionally connect with your audience, they have no choice but to pay attention.
