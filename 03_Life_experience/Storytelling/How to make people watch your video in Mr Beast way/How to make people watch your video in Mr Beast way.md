# Mr Beast's framework
- Mr. Beast creates videos with a simple, 3-part framework:
	1. Capture attention
	2. Keep attention
	3. Deliver absurd levels of entertainment to that attention

# 1. Capture attention
- Every one of his videos has some combination of the following:
	- BIG NUMBER
	- I did *insert_absurd_thing*
	- Colorful, eye-catching thumbnail

# 2. Keep attention
- If he can get you to stay for just a few seconds, you're hooked.
- The introduction of any piece of content needs to:
	1. Optimize for SPEED
	2. Immediately create a curiosity gap
	3. Constantly reveal new information to keep the consumer engaged

# 3. Deliver absurd levels of entertainment to that attention
- Don't focus on metrics you have zero control over.
- Instead, have a single north star for everything you create to be 10/10 quality.
