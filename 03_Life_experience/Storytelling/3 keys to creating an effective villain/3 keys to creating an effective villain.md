# TLDR
- The hero and the villain have the **same target but opposite goals** (2 face of the same coin)
- The villain attack the hero's (greatest) **weakness**
	- In order to force her to overcome it
- The villain puts the hero under **immense pressure**
	- In order to force her to grow in a way that she cannot achieve otherwise


# 3 keys to creating an effective villain

## 1. Make the villain and Hero compete for the same goal
- If your Hero and villain fight for the same goal, bringing them into conflict within your story becomes quite natural.
- They should be fighting for **two sides of the same goal**:
	- Order vs Chaos
	- Privacy vs Tracking


## 2. Make the villain attack the Hero’s greatest weaknesses
- Stories are about the transformation the Hero goes through from beginning to end. But how do you make a Hero transform? 
- You don’t heighten her strengths. You **force** her to overcome her weaknesses.
- As a brand, your customer is the Hero. So you make the villain amplify your customer’s biggest pain points. Then you position yourself as the painkiller.


## 3. Use the villain to pressure the Hero into difficult choices

>“True character is revealed in the choices a human being makes under pressure – the greater the pressure, the truer the choice to the character’s essential nature.”
>
>Robert McKee

- When someone mentions ‘raising the stakes’ in a story, this is a great way to leverage your villain to do just that.
- **Remember**: The best villains serve one purpose – to push the Hero to become better than they would be otherwise.

# Brands and Creatives that do this well
## Apple
- Apple turned “privacy invasion” into the sin of big tech, making Facebook, Snap, and others into villains while positioning itself as the protector of consumer privacy.

- Compete for the same thing:
	- Apple positioned itself as for consumer data privacy while positioning its competition as against it.
- Attack the Hero’s weaknesses:
	- Consumers (the Heroes) cannot protect their data privacy by themselves, meaning they need someone else to do it (why not Apple?).
- Pressure the Hero:
	- Apple spent hundreds of millions of dollars on its "Privacy. That's iPhone" campaign to hammer home the point to consumers.

## Christopher Nolan – The Joker
- In The Dark Knight, the Joker and Batman are two sides of the same coin

- Compete for the same thing:
	- The Joker wants to turn Gotham into chaos, while Batman wants to restore order.
- Attack the Hero’s weaknesses:
	- The Joker knows he has no chance of beating Batman on physical strength. So the Joker creates situations where physical strength doesn’t matter.
- Pressure the Hero:
	- The Joker forces Batman into a series of more and more difficult decisions. “If you want order in Gotham, Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in. Every day he doesn’t… people will die.”
