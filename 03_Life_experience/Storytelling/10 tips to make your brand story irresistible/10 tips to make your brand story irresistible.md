# 1) Structure your story predictably:
- Stories in this predictable structure make it easy for the audience to follow.
- Confused customers don't buy.
- In your brand's story make your customer the "hero" and you are their guide.

# 2) Make your audience connect emotionally with the hero
- Make sure your hero is someone they'd root for.
- Customers connect with a hero who is:
	- Relatable
	- Have similar desires
	- Have similar struggles

# 3) Make your hero proactive
- No one is persuaded by a lazy, unmotivated hero.
- Tips:
	- Make your hero’s goal clear
	- Make the hero work to find their next step
	- The hero needs a burning desire to accomplish their goal
	- Give them a big emotional transformation

# 4) Entertain during backstories
- If your story needs an explanation, make it entertaining.
- Ex: MrBeast does a parody of a show, the Squid Games.
	- The rules need explaining.
	- So he explains in the middle of the action:

# 5) Get to your point quickly
- Make your point early in the story or your audience will leave.

# 6) Have one message
- If your story has multiple messages your audience gets confused and the message loses its effect.
- See what I did there?
- Both messages may be true, but focus on one to hit harder.
- You'll persuade more customers.

# 7) Make the danger come fast
- Focus on customer pain that will impact them soon.
- They’ll feel more pressure to act.
- Customers aren’t as concerned about problems that take years to affect them.

# 8) Make your customer transform
- Passionate customers buy a transformation from you.
- Without a transformation, your solution is commoditized.
- Be clear that your customer will be a new person after using your solution.

# 9) Make the villain horrific
- The "villain" is the pain the customer is feeling.
- The pain needs to hurt. The challenge needs to be hard.
- Make the villain stronger than your hero. But make the hero want to win more.

# 10) Target primal emotions
- Your hero’s desires need to be primal:
	- Hunger
	- Survival
	- Sex/love
	- Fear of death
- Primal desires persuade more customers.
