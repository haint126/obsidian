# World Building
- World Building is the subset of storytelling
- Here are two tactics used by JRR Tolkien to build his worlds

## Focus on language
- Create unique, shared language with your audience. Tolkien [invented](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tcHJuZXdzLm9yZy9zdG9yeS8yMDE1LzAzLzMxL2Jvb2tzLWJjc3QtcXVlc3Rpb24tdG9sa2llbi1sYW5ndWFnZXMiLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiYWUxMGQ5NWYtMTMwMS00YzIyLThlM2ItYTE1YWY4ODM5ZmRmIiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiJhYjQ2MmY1MC1hYmM2LTRjYmEtYjU3ZS01YTcxOGJhZTRkODIiLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6IjU3ZGNkZTk1LTgxZWMtNDUyZC1iYjBkLWFkN2FiNTMzMzY4NSIsImlhdCI6MTY2Mjk5MjQ1My4wNzYsImlzcyI6Im9yY2hpZCJ9._Enx8w9IQy1-8vNd1yDlCUroDTbT2adLbfQzlYFu8vE) 15 new languages for his books (don't sweat, you don’t have to do that).
- You want to create phrases that become so common for your audience they associate them with you or your brand. It’s like inside jokes – shared lingo that only makes sense in your world.
	- iMessage = Apple
	    - Apple owns the ‘i’ in front of its products. No other brand can use that without Apple first coming to mind.
	- wingardium leviosa = Harry Potter
	    - I went to a wedding where the couple exited through everyone holding sparklers. I heard at least five people say this Latin-derived hodgepodge JK Rowling invented 20 years ago. That’s powerful.

## Create rituals
- Tolkien gave each of the different cultures he created their own customs and rituals. People function in this way. Shared rituals make us feel part of a group.
- Now let me do the unthinkable and jump from Tolkien to a cookie company to give you an example of a brand crushing by creating a weekly ritual:
	- [Crumbl Cookies](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2NydW1ibGNvb2tpZXMuY29tLyIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiJhZTEwZDk1Zi0xMzAxLTRjMjItOGUzYi1hMTVhZjg4MzlmZGYiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6ImFiNDYyZjUwLWFiYzYtNGNiYS1iNTdlLTVhNzE4YmFlNGQ4MiIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiNTdkY2RlOTUtODFlYy00NTJkLWJiMGQtYWQ3YWI1MzMzNjg1IiwiaWF0IjoxNjYyOTkyNDUzLjA3NiwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.UhZKRkBxJYD2l0PYPziATBVMgGU_8RC_P6Bd0gHnN04): Each week, Crumbl releases a new lineup of six cookies to replace last week’s lineup. This creates a sense of anticipation (Crumbl fans look forward to the drop), a sense of urgency (if you don’t buy that kind of cookie this week, you may never again have the chance), and a sense of togetherness (the launch posts get hundreds of thousands of likes on IG and TikTok).
