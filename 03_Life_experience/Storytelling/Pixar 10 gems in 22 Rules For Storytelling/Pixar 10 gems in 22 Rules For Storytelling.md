# 1. Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.
- The right ending serves as a target to keep your story on the most concise and effective path.
- It’s like a magnet pulling your story forward.

# 2. Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You'll feel like you're losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.
- When time and space is limited, you’re forced to be more creative and ambitious through character and plot without relying on other gimmicks.

# 3. Finish your story, even if it's not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on and do better next time.
- I’m a firm believer there’s one way to get good at anything:
	1. Get started
	2. Get consistent
	3. Get good
- Storytelling is no different.

# 4. Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you. You've got to recognize it before you can use it.
- Your favorite book is The Martian?
	- Study what Andy Weir does
		- His cadence
		- His hook
		- His closing
		- His word choice.

# 5. Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, just an idea, you'll never share it with anyone.
- Writing and editing are different processes.
- Your first draft will be bad. Edit it to make it better.

# 6. Discount the first thing that comes to mind. And the second, third... get the obvious ones out of the way. Then surprise yourself.
- Ed Sheeran likens his songwriting process to a dirty faucet. Turn it on, flows dirty. Leave it on, clean water starts to flow.

# 7. Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great. Coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.
- Make everything as hard as possible for your characters.
- That may mean some unfair situations. But it does not mean lucky situations.

# 8. Take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How do you rearrange them into what you do like?
- Do this with any story medium – speech, pitch deck, landing page, etc.
- Focus on:
	- Characters – did you care about them?
	- Arc – what changed?
	- Emotion – what did you feel?

# 9. Keep in mind what's interesting to you as an audience, not what's fun to do as a writer.
- Steven Pressfield:
	- “The skill that is indispensable to all artists and entrepreneurs – the ability to switch in your imagination from your point of view to the POV of your audience.”

# 10. The story spine
- The story spine:
	- Once upon a time there was
	- Every day
	- One day
	- Because of that
	- Because of that
	- Until finally
	- Humans gravitate to structure.
- See this story structure once, you see it everywhere.
