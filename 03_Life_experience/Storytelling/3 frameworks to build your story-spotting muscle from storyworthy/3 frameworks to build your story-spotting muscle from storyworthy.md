![[03_Life_experience/Storytelling/3 frameworks to build your story-spotting muscle from storyworthy/Homework for life.jpg]]

- Most people think stories have to be some incredible adventure, like the movies.
	- But the truth is, you have storyworthy moments every day.
	- You've just never stopped to capture them.
- Doing Homework for Life is simple.
	- Every day, you take five minutes to reflect:
	- If you had to tell a story from today - a five-minute story about something that took place over the course of the day, what would it be?
	- And all you have to do is write one sentence about it.
- Finding stories is a skill - and you need to practice it every day.
	- You start to recognize storyworthy moments in the simplest things.
	- You become appreciative of moments that for years you've overlooked.

# Framework #2: Crash and Burn

- The goal of Crash and Burn is to clear the ideas clogged up in your head and get them onto the page.
- It's a simple five-minute stream of consciousness writing exercise with three rules:
	- Rule #1: You must not get attached to any one idea
		- New ideas are going to fly from every direction.
		- Every time a new idea pops up, let it take over.
	- Rule #2: You must not judge any thought or idea that appears in your mind
		- Every idea that pops into your head must make it onto the page.
		- Also - handwriting, grammar, punctuation, capitalization - forget about all of it.
	- Rule #3: You cannot allow the pen to stop moving.
		- This is the most important rule.
		- If you feel yourself slowing down, start listing items until they trigger a memory.
			- Fruits
			- Colors
			- People
			- Numbers
- Dicks recommends doing Crash and Burn every day for 15 minutes.
- The freewriting session lasts five minutes.
	- And afterward, you spend 10 minutes reading it over, finding the storyworthy threads.

# Framework #3: First, Last, Best, Worst
![[03_Life_experience/Storytelling/3 frameworks to build your story-spotting muscle from storyworthy/First last best worst.jpg]]

- As you go about your life, you forget many of your storyworthy moments.
	- They're like gaps in your memory, waiting to be filled.
	- And First, Last, Best, Worst is built to fill in those gaps.
- To do this exercise:
	- Make a grid with five columns along the top
		- Prompt
		- First
		- Last
		- Best
		- Worst
	- And under the prompt column, list any of the following prompts:
		- Pet
		- Job
		- Skill
		- Gift
		- Book
		- Travel
		- Trouble
		- Advice
		- Investment
	- For each prompt, find your first, last, best, and worst moment or memory for each of them.
- This creates an ABSURD amount of raw material for storytelling.
- To reflect on what you wrote, look at each box in the grid to find anything worth keeping.
	- Hint: look for repeat answers.
