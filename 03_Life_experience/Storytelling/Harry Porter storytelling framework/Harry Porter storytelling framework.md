# The key concepts
- JK Rowling used 1 storytelling framework for the entire series.
	- She used the same (or a very similar) structure across each of the books.
- The outline is divided into 10 columns.
- Broadly, the 10 can be sorted into two buckets:
	1. Progress & Progression
	2. Subplots & Characters

- It’s brilliant in its simplicity.

## Progress & Progression
- Every story needs to feel like it’s ripping forward.
- JK does this with:
	- Time
	- Chapter
	- Plot
- The pace makes the reader turn the page.

## Subplots & Characters
- Storytelling is about maximizing tension and conflict.
- The 5th Harry Potter was over 850 pages.
	- But only had 1 main plot, 5 subplots, and less than 10 key characters.

> [!NOTE]
> Lesson: focus your story.

# The outline
- Each row is a chapter.
	- And each chapter includes at least 3 subplots.
	- They’re all interconnected and they all drive the main plot forward.
	- There is zero wasted space, and JK does the same thing from book 1 to 7.
- Rowling told the story in layers.
	- She interconnected:
		- The current generation
		- The previous generation
		- The generation before that
	- Each layer added a level of complexity for both her and the reader.
		- But her structure kept it cohesive.
- If Rowling does have a structure like this wrapped around the whole series, this is what I imagine it looks like:
	- 7 books for 7 years
	- 1 main plot per book
	- 5 interconnected subplots throughout
	- All designed to come to a crescendo in book 7.
