# 1. Cut the fluff
- Try a “cold open” - jump straight into the action.
- Create intrigue then incorporate the backstory later.

# 2. Create a hero
- Your audience needs a hero to experience the story through.
- Common traits from Harry Potter to Bruce Wayne:
	- Start as an underdog / orphan
	- Overcome their greatest fears
	- Helped by mentors
- We want characters to succeed but we don’t want success to come easy.

# 3. Build a world
- JK Rowling says: “There’s always room for a story that can transport people to another place.”
- A few tips to create your world:
	- Use rituals
	- Create shared language
	- Define its laws
- Storytelling is how you introduce people into the world you’ve built.

# 4. Layer on the drama.
- When you don’t think something can get worse, make it worse.
- When your character is facing adversity and their back is against the wall, you have the makings of a great story.

# 5. Use hooks continuously
- The longer your story is, the more hooks you need.
	- Cliffhangers
	- Agitating the problem
	- Unanswered Qs
- For his product launches, Steve Jobs ‘agitated the problem’ multiple times throughout.

# 6. Study your audience
- Your story is not for everyone.
- Identify your target audience and ask intentional questions.
- Brand storytelling Qs:
	- How can we get more specific?
	- What are the biggest problems our customers are facing?
	- What’s their ideal transformation look like?

# 7. Slow down
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in.
	- When speaking, stop talking for 3 seconds.
	- When writing, make your paragraphs longer, add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- Force your audience to hang on to every word.


# 8. Use data sparingly but intentionally
- If you use too many numbers, none of them matter.
- Instead, pick the most impactful and use those to amplify your story.
- “Numbers tell, stories sell.”

# 9. Build to one moment
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment.
- But what is the moment about?
	- Change - I once was this, but now I’m this.
- Here’s Steve Jobs’ one moment at the iPhone launch - “today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.”

# 10. Shape your story
- Creatives like to avoid structure. But your audience needs it to follow your story.
- Luckily there are proven frameworks you can adapt:
	- StoryBrand
	- Hero’s Journey
	- Three Act
