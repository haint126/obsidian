# Bicycle selling guy
- Two MBA students go to a job interview:
	- Interested in finance guy
	- Bicycle selling guy
- The stuff in the CV is the matter of the past
- Story telling is what going to matter in the future
	- Stories are gonna create connections, generate sales, all the stuff that matters

# The story of two men learning to fish:
- The first fisherman:
	- He heads straight to the marina to buy the best fishing equipment
	- He spends time reading up on everything there is know about fishing
	- He's watching the fishing channel every night for hours, learning from the best of the best.
	- A few months later, he finally feels ready to fish
	- The next day, he heads out on the lake in his new boat with his fancy rod and wealth of fishing "experience" built up over the last few months.
		- But six hours in, nothing. Not even a nibble.
		- What happened?
			- Turns out, the second fisherman had already sucked the lake dry.
- The second fisherman
	- On day one, he grabbed a shitty rod, sliced up a hot dog, and went out to the lake.
	- The first week, nothing happened
	- But on the eighth day? His first nibble.
	- And every day after, he honed his technique:
		- Find a bit better baiting technique
		- Find a new spot with a few more fish.
	- After three weeks of iteration, he found the winning combination.
	- Before long, he was hauling in hundreds of fish every day.
	- To keep up with his daily haul, he hired a small team to help him.
	- And from there, he opened a restaurant with fat margins to sell his fresh fish.
	- And after that, he opened a fishing school to teach others his craft.
- Both fishermen try their best to learn, but there was one difference: **feedback**.
	- Every day the second fisherman had an idea of something that might work better.
		- And he went right to the market to **validate** his assumption.
		- If it worked, his strategy improved.
		- And if it failed, he learned something new.
- The moral of this story?
	- Get to action as quickly as possible.

# Unclog the pipe
- To find your best ideas, you need to unclog all the junk first.
- At the beginning of a writing session, write out every bad idea that reflexively comes to mind.
	- Instead of being self-critical and resisting these bad ideas, accept them.
	- Once you've generated enough bad output, your mind begins to reflexively identify which elements caused the badness.
		- Then it begins to avoid them
- Once the bad ideas are emptied, strong ideas begin to arrive.
=> OR try many many times to succeed a few

# Making It Personal
- The company has about 30 employees and right around Thanksgiving, the CEO gives each employee $1,000.
	- He says you must give the $1,000 to someone else.
- The challenge is to not give the money to a charity, but rather to truly look at the people around you.
	- Find someone who needs a break.
	- No questions asked, no stipulations, just a gift for someone that could use a hand at a trying time.
- The CEO gathers everyone together on Zoom before they all leave for a week off for the holidays.
	- Each person goes around and shares (without saying a name) the person that they gave the money.
	- The stories are amazing.
	- People cry, people laugh, people experience something most of us don't feel often enough.
- You get the experience to make someone's day and have a few hours of hearing incredible stories.

# The fear of losing 4.0 score
- [Source](https://twitter.com/ChideraSays/status/1605188523447013376)
- After I'm done working for the day I completely shut off.
	- I won't respond to any annoying texts (usually from my mom)
	- Commit to starting any new assignments
	- Or do anything else that anybody wants me to do
	- I totally give in to laziness
- But I am a star student so my grades are very important to me
	- However, everything that needs to be done during the day always gets done.
	- So my grades (or anything else) are never something I have to worry about during my
	- "leave me fucking alone time"
- One particular day, however, I wasn't as careful and something slipped by me.
- Drifting off to sleep I received a notification...
- I checked my phone and saw a message that an online exam was due in 30 mins.
- I literally jumped out of bed and got to work immediately.
- The thing that sprung into my mind wasn't the life I couldn't have if I got a 0 on that exam
- It was FEAR
	- The fear of failure
	- The fear of losing my 4.0
	- The fear of my parents being disappointed
- Fear made me forget how good my bed felt and jump into action despite that.
- => **Fear is the ultimate motivator**
	- It trumps everything else
- **Fear is the double-edged sword of success**

# The Gambler's Ruin: David vs Goliath
- [Source](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1609607018750287873)
- David vs Goliath:
	- David is a "small" player with $2000
	- David is a "big" player with $10000
	- David has a 55% chance of winning any given round -- as opposed to Goliath's 45%.
	- After each round, the *loser* gives the *winner* some of their resources
	- This goes on until one of the players is wiped out -- ie, has no more resources left
- You can use Markov Chain to calculate each person odd of winning
- If each round costs the loser $1000
	- David only has ~36% chance of winning the battle
	- The odds favor Goliath nearly 2 to 1
- If each round costs the loser $100
	- Now, the odds flip -- to *overwhelmingly* favor David.
	- He ends up beating Goliath about 98% of the time!
- => The power of each round being a "low cost" experiment
