- A study from Princeton shows the same parts of the brain light up in both the speaker and the listener of a story.
- Jobs used this to transfer his energy, his excitement to his audience.
- You’ll notice this framework is similar to the classic “Hero’s journey.”

# 1. Use a hook
- A tantalizing statement to draw the audience in.
- Here Jobs promises “a revolutionary product that changes everything.”


# 2. Create the buildup
- Set the context by using comparisons on the scale you hope to achieve.
- Here Jobs compares what he’s revealing to the Macintosh 1 and the iPod
- Two products that, as he reminds you, changed entire industries.

# 3. Introduce confrontation
- If there’s no problem, then there’s no suspense, no entertainment.
- Every great story has a villain – whether fiction or in business.
- Here, Jobs makes it the smart phone.

# 4. Climax
- Bring on the drama.
- Jobs says “Apple is going to reinvent the phone.”
- He was right 
- But think about how bold that claim was in 2007 before anyone had heart the word “iPhone.”

# 5. Demonstrate it
- Show your audience why your product – your story – is important.
- Jobs does a great job injecting humor here.


# 6. Bring back the problem
- Remind everyone how annoying the current state is.
- It’s painful — and that’s why your product is needed.

# 7. Wrap it up
- Position your product as an elixir.
- In 30 seconds, Jobs lists 13 different features of the iPhone that traditional phones didn’t have.
- Include your call to action – what you want people to do.
