# Rule #1: You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.
- Focus on the how and why (and less on the what).

# Rule #2: You gotta keep in mind what’s interesting to you as an audience, not what’s fun to do as a writer
- You, the writer, are completely irrelevant.
- Focus on delivering to the audience.

# Rule #3: Trying for theme is important, but you won’t see what the story is actually about till you’re at the end of it. Now rewrite.
- Your original idea rarely ends up the same as your final idea.
- So don't overthink it - take something, get it going, then refine it.

# Rule #4: Once upon a time there was __ . Every day, __ . One day __ . Because of that, __ . Because of that, __ . Until finally __ .
- You can use this "story spine" to effortlessly create a narrative.

# Rule #5: Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You’ll feel like you’re losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.
- The goal should be to add constraints and do more with less.

# Rule #6: What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?

# Rule #7: Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.

# Rule #8: Finish your story, let go even if it’s not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time.
- Don't let perfectionism keep you from publishing.

# Rule #9: When you’re stuck, make a list of what WOULDN’T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.

# Rule #10: Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.
- 90% of being a good writer or storyteller is being a good *noticer*
- Notice when things resonate with you and start asking why.

# Rule #11: Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you’ll never share it with anyone.

# Rule #12: Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th – get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself.
- To find your best ideas, you need to unclog all the junk first.
- At the beginning of a writing session, write out every bad idea that reflexively comes to mind.
	- Instead of being self-critical and resisting these bad ideas, accept them.
	- Once you've generated enough bad output, your mind begins to reflexively identify which elements caused the badness.
		- Then it begins to avoid them
- Once the bad ideas are emptied, strong ideas begin to arrive.
=> OR try many many times to succeed a few

# Rule #13: Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it’s poison to the audience.

# Rule #14: Why must you tell THIS story? What’s the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That’s the heart of it.

# Rule #15: If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.

# Rule #16: What are the stakes? Give us a reason to root for the character. What happens if they don’t succeed? Stack the odds against.

# Rule #17: No work is ever wasted. If it’s not working, let go and move on - it’ll come back around to be useful later.
- Focus on showing up - consistency creates competence.

# Rule #18: You have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best & fussing. Story is testing, not refining.
- Too often people get caught up in trying to plan every step from A to Z.
- And this "planning" is really procrastination in disguise.

# Rule #19: Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.

# Rule #20: Exercise: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How would you rearrange them into what you DO like?

# Rule #21: You gotta identify with your situation/characters, can’t just write ‘cool’. What would make YOU act that way?
- Make your listener feel understood (through authenticity).

# Rule #22: What’s the essence of your story? Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build from there.
- And the best for last - ask yourself: what are you *really* trying to say (in as few words as possible).
- Strip away everything that distracts from that goal.

# Rule #23: Be aware of the conventions & assumptions that go with your genre. Acknowledge them, then subvert them; don't ignore them.
