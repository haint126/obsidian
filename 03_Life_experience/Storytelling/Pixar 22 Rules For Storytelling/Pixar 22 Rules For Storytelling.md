# Rule #1: You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.
- Focus on the how and why (and less on the what).

# Rule #2: You have to keep in mind what’s interesting to you as an audience, not what’s fun to do as a writer
- You, the writer, are completely irrelevant.
- Focus on delivering to the audience.

# Rule #3: Trying for theme is important, but you won’t see what the story is actually about till you’re at the end of it. Now rewrite.
- Your original idea rarely ends up the same as your final idea.
- So don't overthink it - take something, get it going, then refine it.

# Rule #4: Once upon a time there was __ . Every day, __ . One day __ . Because of that, __ . Because of that, __ . Until finally __ .
- You can use this "story spine" to effortlessly create a narrative.
- What each of these actually means:
	1. Establish setting – the “normal world”
	2. Show character in normal world
	3. Boom, something happens to throw the normal world into chaos
	4. Another thing happens to make it harder for your characters
	5. Yet another thing makes it harder for your characters
	6. Your characters overcome and are better for it
- Pixar including the double “because of that” shows the importance of raising the stakes throughout your story.

# Rule #5: Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You’ll feel like you’re losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.
- The goal should be to add constraints and do more with less.
- The 5th Harry Potter is an 800+ page book with one main plot and five subplots
- There’s no need for your story to have more than that. Assuming its shorter, aiming for just one or two subplots is even better.
- Simplicity makes it easier for your audience to track and remember your story.

# Rule #6: What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?
- Stories are about the transformation the Hero:
	- You challenge her to overcome her weaknesses.

# Rule #7: Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.

# Rule #8: Finish your story, let go even if it’s not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time.
- Don't let perfectionism keep you from publishing.

# Rule #9: When you’re stuck, make a list of what WOULDN’T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.
- You can make this step easier by changing your working location

# Rule #10: Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.
- 90% of being a good writer or storyteller is being a good *noticer*
- Notice when things resonate with you and start asking why.

# Rule #11: Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you’ll never share it with anyone.

# Rule #12: Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th – get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself.
- To find your best ideas, you need to unclog all the junk first.
- At the beginning of a writing session, write out every bad idea that reflexively comes to mind.
	- Instead of being self-critical and resisting these bad ideas, accept them.
	- Once you've generated enough bad output, your mind begins to reflexively identify which elements caused the badness.
		- Then it begins to avoid them
- Once the bad ideas are emptied, strong ideas begin to arrive.
=> OR try many many times to succeed a few

# Rule #13: Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it’s poison to the audience.
- Give your characters traits, thoughts and characteristics

# Rule #14: Why must you tell THIS story? What’s the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That’s the heart of it.
- What about this story is uniquely you?
- And can you embed that into the story to make it special?
# Rule #15: If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.

# Rule #16: What are the stakes? Give us a reason to root for the character. What happens if they don’t succeed? Stack the odds against.

# Rule #17: No work is ever wasted. If it’s not working, let go and move on - it’ll come back around to be useful later.
- Focus on showing up - consistency creates competence.

# Rule #18: You have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best & fussing. Story is testing, not refining.
- Too often people get caught up in trying to plan every step from A to Z.
- And this "planning" is really procrastination in disguise.

# Rule #19: Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.

# Rule #20: Exercise: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How would you rearrange them into what you DO like?

# Rule #21: You gotta identify with your situation/characters, can’t just write ‘cool’. What would make YOU act that way?
- Make your listener feel understood (through authenticity).

# Rule #22: What’s the essence of your story? Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build from there.
- And the best for last - ask yourself: what are you *really* trying to say (in as few words as possible).
- Strip away everything that distracts from that goal.

# Rule #23: Be aware of the conventions & assumptions that go with your genre. Acknowledge them, then subvert them; don't ignore them.
