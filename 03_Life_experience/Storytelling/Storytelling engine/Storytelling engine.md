# Storytelling engine ?
- A storytelling engine is a repeatable narrative structure a company, author, or other creative uses to crank out a new but similar version of the same story.

# How ?
- Tell a lot of stories
- Audit the content to identify similar narrative structures and key elements
- **Templatize those structures**
- Fit upcoming stories into the structures, if possible
- Add your special sauce:
	- The danger of a storytelling engine is letting your story become too stiff and unnatural
