- Our ancestor's lives are full of hardships
- Our current lives are frictionless:
	- Frictionless Commerce: e-commerce, one-click-checkout, and mobile pay
	- Frictionless Communication: dating apps, messaging services, and social networking apps
	- Frictionless Work: remote work

- A frictionless life is an "easy" life
- "Easy" can be good but it is a double-edge sword

- Our steady, monotonous friction avoidance is reducing texture in our lives, causing it to pass by quickly and without purpose or meaning.
- We are losing our ability to endure and outlast struggles.

- In a world of steadily decreasing friction, it will be those who are willing to embrace friction that will thrive
