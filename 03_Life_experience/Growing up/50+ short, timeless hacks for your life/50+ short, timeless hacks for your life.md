# Life Hacks
- Never think twice about investments in yourself:
	- Books
	- Quality food
	- Fitness
	- Personal development
- Think about material purchases instead
	- Wait 48 hours to complete an order to see if you still want it

- Learn one funny or good dance move that you can reliably bust out
- Reread your favorite books annually
- In your 20s and 30s, do a few crazy things to create a few stories worth telling.
- Be bored for at least 15 minutes per day
	- To create your creative zone
- Take yourself out for a meal alone once each month
	- For the sake of boredom -> Creativity
- If you're about to say yes to something on the assumption that you'll have more time for it in the future, say no instead
- Send a letter to your future self once each year on your birthday
- Have at least one thing in your life that you are bad at but love doing
- Do one hard thing every day when you could do it the easy way
	- -> Train yourself to deal with friction
- As a rule of thumb, don’t consume the news unless you're highly confident it will matter one month from now
- Write down three things you’re grateful for every single night before you go to bed
	- Say one of them out loud every single morning when you wake up.
- Stop trying to be interesting and focus on being interested
	- Interested people are prone to
		- Giving their deep attention to something to learn more about it
		- Open up to the world
		- Ask great questions & observe
- Stop trying to remember things and just write everything down
- When trying to break a bad habit, wear a small rubber band on your wrist and snap it (lightly) on yourself each time you do the thing you're trying to stop
- When faced with a difficult decision, ask yourself what your 80-year-old self and 10-year-old self would want you to do.
	- Your 80-year-old self is most concerned with the long-term compounding of the action
	- While your 10-year-old self will remind you to have some fun

# Career Hacks
- Spend 15 minutes on Sunday evening preparing for what your first focus tasks are going to be on Monday morning
- When you're starting your career, "swallow the frog" for your boss (do the things they hate doing)
- Set your emails to have a 60-second delay before sending
	- To check for errors
- Batch email processing into condensed time windows
	- Depending on your industry, it may be anywhere from 1-3 windows per day
	- Force a time constraint on low-value tasks to get them done efficiently.
- When you're trying to learn something new, attempt to teach it to a friend or family member
	- Make them ask questions
- Download a free focus app (I like [Flow](https://flowapp.info/)) to execute short sprints of focused work.

# Relationship Hacks
- When you think something nice about someone, let them know
- Tell your partner one thing you appreciate about them every single day
- Invest in personalized stationery and use it regularly
	- Emails and texts lack personality
	- Good penmanship and a handwritten note will always stand out
- If you’re trying to make conversation with someone that you are intimidated by, ask what they're currently working on that they're most excited about
	- Ask follow ups and listen intently.
- When someone is going through hell, just saying “I’m with you” is the most powerful thing you can do
- Record a video interview with your parents
	- Ask them questions and have them tell stories about their childhood, adventures, hopes, dreams, and fears
- If someone tries to put down your accomplishments, cut them out of your life
- If you’re torn on what gift to send someone, send a book
- Carry a pocket notebook and pen with you everywhere you go.
	- If you’re with someone and they say something interesting, take it out and write it down
- When you meet someone, say their name back to them once in conversation
- Never keep score in life
	- When you’re with friends, pick up the check now and then
- If someone regularly brags about their wealth, income, or success, just assume the reality is about 50% of what they say.
- If you’re about to take an emotion-induced action, wait 24 hours
- The first time someone acts negatively toward you, assume they are just having a bad day. The second time someone acts negatively toward you, assume they are a bad person.
- Give a stranger a compliment every single day
	- Getting a simple compliment from someone can make a person's entire day.

# Health Hacks
- If you're struggling to fall asleep, try the 4-7-8 method:
	- Breathe in through your nose for a 4-second count
	- Hold your breath for a 7-second count
	- Exhale for an 8-second count
- Go for a 15 minute walk every morning
	- Leave the phone at home
- To get your body moving to start the day, try the 5-5-5-30 morning routine:
	- When you wake up, do 5 push-ups, 5 squats, 5 lunges, and a 30-second plank
- To eat healthier, do all of your shopping on the outer perimeter of the grocery store
- If you’re trying to lose weight or lean out, do 25 jump ropes between each set of exercises at the gym

# Money Hacks
- Be frugal with yourself and generous with others.
- If an investment or financial opportunity seems too good to be true, assume that it probably is.
	- Remember: There’s no such thing as a free lunch.
- Create an automated direct deposit for a small amount of money into an investment account every month
	- Never look at the account. Don't pay any attention to it
- Tip 30%+ around the holidays (only in US)
- Treat your credit card like a debit card—assume the money is leaving your bank account when you swipe it
- Tip the bartender at your local bar very graciously the first time you go (only in US)
