# 1. Time as an asset
- Most people ignore the value of their time—until it’s too late.
- Time is your most precious asset. It should be respected and leveraged to its fullest potential.
- Treat time as the ultimate currency—it’s all you have and you’ll never get it back.

# 2. Process over outcomes
- When we focus on outcomes, endpoints, and goals, we are playing finite games.
	- We set ourselves up for the disappointment that follows a miss because it’s not what we expected.
- When we focus on process, we are playing infinite games.
	- We can get off the treadmill and take pride in the daily progress that comes with consistently showing up and doing what you say.
- Those who play infinite games will always win in the long run.
	- 1% better every single day.

# 3. Destruction as a necessary precursor to rebirth.
- Periods of creation are filled with growth and fulfillment.
- Periods of destruction are painful and dark.
- But in the context of the recurring cycles, we can recognize them as necessary for the brilliance of rebirth.
- Destruction (failure) is an essential part of the journey.

# 4. Learning by doing.
- The traditional model: Learn—>Do.
- The better way: Do—>Learn—>Do.
- You’ll always learn more in the trenches than from any classroom, book, or course.
- People with a bias for action will always have a competitive advantage.

# 5. Imposter syndrome as a growth opportunity.
- A reframe:
	- Imposter: “I don't know what I'm doing. It's only a matter of time until everyone finds out.”
	- Reframe: "I don't know what I'm doing YET. It's only a matter of time until I figure it out."
- This simple reframe is extraordinarily powerful.
- By definition, everyone is an imposter…until they’re not.
- Give yourself the freedom and space to figure it out. Trust in your ability to pursue your curiosity and make progress.

# 6. The only move that matters is the next move.
- Most people waste energy on:
	- Past Moves—what could have been
	- Future Moves—what might become
- The only move that matters is the next move.
- Don’t waste energy on the past or the distant future—focus in the present.

# 7. The only worthwhile comparison is to your yesterday.
- We all need to stop comparing ourselves to someone else’s today.
- Look in, not out—the only comparison that matters is to your yesterday.
	- How have I changed?
	- How have I grown?
	- What good have I done?

# 8. Identity follows actions.
- If you wait to start something until you are able to make it a part of your identity, you may never get there.
- Actions can build identity.
- Start moving—you’ll notice that your identity will begin to align with the actions you’re taking.

# 9. You make your own luck.
- Your daily actions can put you in a position where luck is more likely to strike.
	- It’s hard to get lucky watching TV at home
	- It’s easy to get lucky when you’re engaging and learning.
- Pursue the path that has the larger luck surface area.

# 10. Curiosity replaces envy.
- The next time you feel envious of someone else’s life, reframe the envy as curiosity:
	- What did this person do to achieve the thing you are envious of?
	- What can you learn and apply from their story to improve your situation?

# 11. Embracing feedback (vs. taking it).
- Feedback enables “software updates” to improve upon the old.
- But there’s a big difference between taking it and truly embracing it.
- Embracing feedback means opening up
	- It means being vulnerable and owning incompetencies.
