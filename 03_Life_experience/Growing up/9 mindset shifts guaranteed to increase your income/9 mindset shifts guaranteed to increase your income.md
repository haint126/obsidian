# TLDR
- Seek to learn more
- Deliver value then money will follow
- Focus on the outcome
	- Not your idea or your product
- Losing the fear of failure
- Solve impactful problems not lengthy problems
- Knowing when to pivot and iterate
	- Continuous iteration = continuous grow
- Do not start until you know the root of the problem
- Be empathetic and stop arguing
- Build skills
	- Failure = opportunity to learn

# Know-it-all to know-nothing:
- When we're young we believe we know everything.
	- But the truth is we're operating with several blind spots that are holding us back.
- The sooner we realize "I don't know" doesn't make us dumb, the faster we can learn and make more.

# Money to value focused:
- It's easy to get excited about lining your pockets with cash.
- But it's not that simple, you must first deliver 10x the value you hope to receive.
- Rewire your brain to put prospects and customers first, being selfish doesn't work. Money follows value.

# Being right to getting it right:
- Immature people risk relationships and reputation to be proven right.
- But sacrificing the best outcome for your benefit is at odds with your clients' interests.
- Instead, deliver quality solutions and be positioned to capture more value $

# Losing the fear of failure:
- Failure is 1000x bigger in our own minds than in reality.
- Starting a company or going for a big job is intimidating, but nobody is going to voluntarily hand you more money.
- If you want it, you'll need to take on some risk to go get it.

# Working hard to working on hard things:
- Putting in more hours is not a sustainable strategy to earn more.
- Instead work on complex problems that create enormous profits when solved.
	- You'll be rewarded proportionally to the impact not your effort.

# Knowing when to pivot:
- "Quitters never win."
	- This advice is misconstrued and encourages trying the same failed tactics over and over.
- Channel your determination into testing strategies until you produce results.
- Continuous iteration = continuous growth of income.

# Pitching to listening:
- Amateurs dive head first into product pitches wreaking of "commission breath."
- This won't work.
	- You can't help someone without understanding their pain or motivation.
- The product is irrelevant, focus on curing pain and money will flow to you.

# Argumentative to understanding:
- Not only is it impossible to win an argument, but it's a colossal waste of time.
- It's better to practice empathy because you'll become more likable and form stronger relationships.
- Relationships are the foundation for all future opportunities.

# Losing to learning:
- If you don't get your way, you have two choices:
	- a. feel sorry for yourself
	- b. analyze and improve
- The latter will help you learn new skills and tactics that compound over time.
- More skills = more value = more income
