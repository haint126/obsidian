# Operate in Your Zone of Genius
- Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.
- Operating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.
- Once you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.

# Adopt a Positive Sum Mentality
- Want to get ahead in life? Start genuinely rooting for others to succeed.
- When one of us wins, we all win—winning spreads.
- If you adopt that mentality, you’ll become a magnet for the highest quality people.

# Speak Up
- Closed mouths don’t get fed.
- A little push goes a long way. Don't sit back and wait for good things to happen.
- If you want something—and you’ve put in the work for it—ask for it.
- Worst case: you’re told no and nothing has changed.
- Best case: it’s yours.

# Play Long-Term Games
- Life is the ultimate long game.
- Those with low time preference play it more effectively—they happily delay gratification to allow compounding to work its magic.
- In a world of people seeking instant gratification, this is a meaningful edge.

# Have a High Tolerance for Failure
- We fear failure, so most of us play it safe to avoid it.
- But our greatest moments of growth often stem directly from our greatest failures.
- Don't accept failure, but don't fear it either.
- You will fail. Embrace it. Fail smart and fast.

# Follow Your Curiosity
- Humans are born with astonishing curiosity. But somewhere along the way, we're told to stop asking questions.
- Push back.
- Learn to follow your curiosity—trust it.
- For the curious mind, anything is possible. Fortune favors the curious.

# Adopt a Process Orientation
- Prioritize process, not outcomes.
- When you prioritize process, you become flexible in where you are headed—you focus on the inputs and stop worrying about the outputs.
- Just keep laying one brick at a time—forward progress is all that matters.

# Prioritize People
- Everything in life comes down to people and relationships.
- Networks compound as well as any financial investment.
- Build an army of mentors, friends, and evangelists that is deep and wide.
- Cultivate deep relationships, but also embrace the power of weak ties.

# Work Like a Lion
- Modern work culture is a remnant of the Industrial Age. It encourages long periods of steady, monotonous work unsuited for the Information Age.
- If your goal is to do inspired, creative work, you have to work as a lion works.
- Sprint when inspired. Rest. Repeat.

# Become Antifragile
- In Greek mythology, the Hydra is a creature that has multiple heads. When 1 head is cut off, 2 grow back in its place.
- Life is random and chaotic.
- Don't be broken by the chaos—rather, adopt a mentality and build structure such that you will benefit from it.

# Change Your Mind
- Willingness to change one's mind is a rarity in today's society.
- It's great to have a strong view, but always open your mind to counterarguments.
- Stubborn objection to alternative perspectives stalls progress.
- Strive for strong opinions, weakly held.

# Never Get Too Big to Do the Small
- The leaders of the All Blacks rugby team famously stay late to sweep the shed after a match.
- Why? Because small things become big things.
- Whether you're in the mailroom or the corner office, never get too big to do the small things well.

# Learn Storytelling
- Storytelling is a foundational skill—but it's one we don’t learn in the traditional education system.
- It's no coincidence that the highest performers are the strongest storytellers.
- High-leverage storytelling is a supercharger for all human endeavors.

# Develop a Bias for Motion
- A body in motion tends to stay in motion—a body at rest tends to stay at rest.
- When in doubt, just start moving.

# Become Relentlessly Consistent
- Many people are able to produce bursts of energy—few are able to produce consistent, steady flows of energy.
- The former is flashy, but the latter is relentless.
- It's hard to bet against the person who just keeps showing up.

# Simplify Where Others Complicate
- “The definition of genius is taking the complex and making it simple." — Einstein
- Complexity and jargon are often used to mask a lack of deep understanding.
- Learn to convey the complex in simple, digestible ways.
- Find beauty in simplicity.

# Be Comfortable with Discomfort
- We are conditioned to avoid discomfort, so most of us do.
- The problem?
- Discomfort is a precursor to growth—it is an absolute necessity.
- Steel your mind and body—accept and embrace discomfort. Those that do have the ultimate competitive edge.

# Have Strong Plans (Loosely Held)
- It's important to have a plan.
- But as Mike Tyson famously said, "Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth."
- Plans have to be dynamic (and punch-proof!).
- You'll only go as far as your ability to absorb and pivot on the fly.

# Pay It Forward
- No matter how far you go, realize that you didn’t make it on your own.
- Pay it forward. Be a mentor. Be a champion for others.
- Their growth should become a source of tremendous joy and pride.

# Become a Polymath
- A polymath is a person with wide-ranging, multi-disciplinary knowledge.
- Lifelong learners tend to be polymaths—their curiosity naturally leads to knowledge accumulation in a variety of disciplines.
- Learn both horizontally and vertically.

# Give More Than You Receive
- Focus on what you can do for others, not what they can do for you.
- Focus first on the amount of value you create—not the amount that you capture.
- This mentality will lead to more success and growth, but also to more fulfillment and joy.

# Learn to Compartmentalize
- The most successful people in the world share one trait in common: an almost supernatural ability to compartmentalize.
- Create boundaries across your work and personal endeavors.
- When you focus on one, close the others and really focus on it.

# Be Present
- With the rise of technology—and the instant access to millions of people and things that it has provided—the ability to be truly present has become a rarity.
- When you’re with someone—whether a business contact, friend, or partner—be WITH them.
- Put the phone down.
