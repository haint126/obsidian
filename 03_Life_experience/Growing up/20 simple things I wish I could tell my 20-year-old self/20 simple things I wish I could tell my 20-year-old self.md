1. Stop trying to be INTERESTING and focus on being INTERESTED.
2. Call your parents more often—they won't be around forever.
3. Make decisions that your 80-year old self and 10-year-old self would be proud of.

5. Stop caring so much what other people think of you.
6. You won't know what you want to be when you grow up—and that's fine!

11. Not all decisions are reversible, but most of them are.
12. Your college grades don't matter much, but your energy for learning does.

14. Build a tribe of mentors.
15. You have to work hard to achieve great things.
16. Learn to take a punch.

18. You know nothing, but you're not alone.
19. Stop fearing being different—your difference is your edge.
20. Closed mouths don't get fed.
