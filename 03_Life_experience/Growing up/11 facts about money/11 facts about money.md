# 1. Money DOES BUY happiness.
- It is not money that makes you unhappy.
- It is chasing money as makes you unhappy.

# 2. It is (mostly) more profitable to rent than to buy
- Buying is mostly an emotional decision, stemming from a worldview that ownership means success.
- Buy, when you have excess.
- Rent, when you are on a budget.

# 3. You play safe with your money, if you do not know how to make it again.
- Until you do not understand a way of making more money from money, you will always hold on to the money you have.

# 4. Spending money for your well being is an investment.
- Buying a comfortable chair to WFH, is an investment, not an expense.
- Eating healthy, is an investment.
- A good pair of shoes, a good mattress, a good pillow - are investments.
- Therapy is an investment.
- Don't be cheap here!

# 5. Your partner will influence your money, more than your knowledge.
- Who you spend your life with, their worldview, their approach towards money, their rick profile - all have a far bigger influence on how you treat your money, than your own knowledge.

# 6. No one wants to get rich slowly.
- The surest way of getting rich is to be patient with it.
	- Build multiple streams of income
	- Keep expenses low
	- Do not take loans to buy things that make you look rich
	- Invest every month, whether up or down
- It is boring!

# 7. Money's job is to set you free, not make you rich!
- Money gives you choices, it gives you options, it gives you freedom.
- At the best end of the spectrum, it gives you your time.
- That is when money has truly worked for you.

# 8. Rich does not mean wealthy
- You are rich when your active income is a lot.
- You are wealthy when your passive income equals or exceeds living expenses.

# 9. Money will not change you. It will reveal you.
- If you are an inherently kind person, money will make you kinder.
- If you are an inherently charitable person, money will make you more charitable.
- If you are an inherently proud person, money will make you prouder.

# 10. You (most likely) do not know how much money you are chasing. Hence you will keep chasing forever!
- Do you know how much money is that, for you?

# 11. We all have 2 lives when it comes to money
- Get to the amount you need to live life and do all the things you want to do and need to do.
	- 1 is mandatory.
		- Will take time.
		- If you try to find shortcuts, you won't get past it.
- Make more money
	- 2 is optional & a LOT of fun!
