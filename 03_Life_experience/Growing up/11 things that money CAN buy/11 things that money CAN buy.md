# Think
- You can either go after money all your life, or go beyond money.
	- Those who go after it, see it as a powerful thing.
	- Those who go beyond it, see it as a beautiful thing.
	- The choice remains ours.
- As Confucius said "We all have two lives. The second one begins when we realize we just have one."
	- I paraphrase this about money, "We all have two money lives. The second one begins when we realize we have enough for our life."
- Work hard for money. Make it happen. Be smart about it.
	- But know how much you need.
	- Know how much is 'enough'
	- And when you get there, enjoy the money.
	- Make it work for you.
	- Buy the things that money can buy for you!
- Money, in the hands of good people, is a good thing!
