# The 6-page memos short version
- Operational plan has 6 components:
	- Intro
	- Goals
	- Tenets
	- Current state
	- Lessons learned
	- Strategy
- The structure is remarkably similar to that of a story.
	- Intro = Hook
	- Goals and Tenets = Stakes
	- State = Setting and Backstory
	- Lessons and Strategic priorities = Plot

## The 6 components

### Introduction
- Set up precisely what the material is going to **cover**
- Inherently state the general **direction** of where the document plans on going.

### Goals
- What the **metrics for success**
	- -> Use them as lens to see the remaining document through.

### Tenets
- This is a very Amazon thing where every action has some clearly defined north star.
- Generally, they are **inspirational pillars** that the rest of the plan sits on top of

### State of the business
- What is the current state of the business.
- There needs to be a lot of **detail**
- Sets up the points to **compare** against in the next section.

### Lessons learned
- Outline the current state of the business and its **influence** on creating the goals
- It should be **detailed** enough so the reader can understand the **positive and negative** activities in the prior period.

### Strategic priorities
- This is the meat of the document
- Lays out the **plan** and how to **execute** it
- **Match** up to achieving the **goals** stated at the top of the document.

## Why?
- Bezos made Amazon into a writing culture by banning powerpoint and forcing everyone to write 6-page memos (called “narratives”) for meetings.
	- The narrative structure forces
		- Better thought
		- Better understanding.
	- PPT-style presentations
		- Give permission to gloss over ideas
		- Flatten out any sense of relative importance
		- Ignore the interconnectedness of ideas.
- To put it simply, you write the story of whatever is being discussed in the meeting.
	- This is hard on the presenter, but much easier on the audience.
		- A reversal of the usual meeting.
- Writing a narrative forces a deep understanding of the ideas presented.
	- Errors in your setting, people notice.
	- Errors in your plot, people notice.
	- Errors in your logic, people notice.
	- This idea is as true for business writing as it is for fantasy.
- To me, Amazon’s writing and narrative focus does three things:
	1. Prioritizes clear thinking
	2. Puts idea generation on the individual
	3. Makes knowledge transfer easy
	- Plus, imagine how many pointless calls you’d eliminate if the call owner had to write a six-page paper.

# The 6-page memos long version
- There are different approaches based on the goal of the document
- The memos below is an operational plan document.
	- These are 6-month plans that outline
		- the current state of the business
		- the historical data from the last period
		- the goals for this period
		- how you plan on achieving them
- These operational plans are usually created by a team, not an individual
- Each 6-pager needs to **stand on its own**
	- No attachment
	- Everyone, even people not familiar with the subject, must understand what is going on without additional research

# How Amazon conducts meetings
- Each attendee gets a print out of the document
	- You’re not allowed to read the document from your computer
- For the first 20 minutes of a 60-minute meeting, Amazon holds silent meetings.
	- Each attendee reads the document, and usually write down questions and feedback
- Then they spend the rest of the meeting tearing apart the ideas it presents.
	- Challenging your position
	- Questioning your tactics
	- Make sure the data is valid
- All print outs are handed back at the end of the meeting
- After the meeting, you need to update and recirculate the document to everyone
