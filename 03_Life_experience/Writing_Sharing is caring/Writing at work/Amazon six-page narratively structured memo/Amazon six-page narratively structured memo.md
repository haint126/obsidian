# The 6-page memos
- Each memo has 6 components:
	- Intro
	- Goals
	- Tenets
	- Current state
	- Lessons learned
	- Strategy
- The structure is remarkably similar to that of a story.
	- Intro = Hook
	- Goals and Tenets = Stakes
	- State = Setting and Backstory
	- Lessons and Strategic priorities = Plot

## Introduction
- Set up precisely what the material is going to **cover**
- Inherently state the general **direction** of where the document plans on going.

## Goals
- What the **metrics for success**
	- -> Use them as lens to see the remaining document through.

## Tenets
- This is a very Amazon thing where every action has some clearly defined north star.
- Generally, they are **inspirational pillars** that the rest of the plan sits on top of

## State of the business
- What is the current state of the business.
- There needs to be a lot of **detail**
- Sets up the points to **compare** against in the next section.

## Lessons learned
- Outline the current state of the business and its **influence** on creating the goals
- It should be **detailed** enough so the reader can understand the **positive and negative** activities in the prior period.

## Strategic priorities
- This is the meat of the document
- Lays out the **plan** and how to **execute** it
- **Match** up to achieving the **goals** stated at the top of the document.

# Why?
- Bezos made Amazon into a writing culture by banning powerpoint and forcing everyone to write 6-page memos for meetings.
	- He called them “narratives.”
- The narrative structure… forces better thought and better understanding.
	- PPT-style presentations give permission to gloss over ideas, flatten out any sense of relative importance, and ignore the interconnectedness of ideas.
- To put it simply, you write the story of whatever is being discussed in the meeting.
	- This is hard on the presenter, but much easier on the audience.
	- A reversal of the usual meeting.
- Writing a narrative forces a deep understanding of the ideas presented.
	- Errors in your setting, people notice.
	- Errors in your plot, people notice.
	- Errors in your logic, people notice.
	- This idea is as true for business writing as it is for fantasy.
- To me, Amazon’s writing and narrative focus does three things:

	1. Prioritizes clear thinking
	2. Puts idea generation on the individual
	3. Makes knowledge transfer easy

	- Plus, imagine how many pointless calls you’d eliminate if the call owner had to write a six-page paper.

# How?
- For the first 20 minutes of each meeting, Amazon holds silent meetings.
- Each attendee gets 20 minutes to read the document.
- Then they spend the rest of the meeting tearing apart the ideas it presents.
