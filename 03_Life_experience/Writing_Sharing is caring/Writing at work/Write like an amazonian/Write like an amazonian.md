# Amazon writing style tip 1

# Amazon writing style tip 2

	- Adjectives are imprecise and don't contribute to making a decision
	- Most Amazonians react negatively to buzz words and qualifications without data
- Examples: Subjective -> Objective
	- Sales *increased significantly* in Q4, due to use of holiday promotions
		- -> Unit sales increased *by 40%* in Q4 2011, compared to Q4 2010, because of holiday promotions
	- We made the application *much faster*
		- -> We reduced server side trailing 90-day latency *from 10ms to 1ms*
	- This will make the endeavor *extremely successful*
		- -> This will increase output *by 2.5%*
