# Write line by line
- The worst thing you can be online is boring.
- If you don’t vary sentence length, your reader will drown you out. So, use this trick:
	- Write your drafts line by line
	- Make your sentences sing.

# Rule of One
- Most writers attempt to say too much.
	- But if you try to please everyone, you please no one.
- Always use the Rule of One:
	- One big idea
	- One captivating story
	- One core emotion
	- One core benefit
	- One call to action
- Specificity is the secret.

# The 50% Rule
- Schools teach you to maximize word counts. The internet does the opposite.
- Set a rule to force more quality:
	- From first draft to publishing, reduce the volume by 50%.
- Say what needs to be said, then say no more.

# Round 2 Writing
- Most people publish and move on.
- But your best ideas are a result of iteration.
- If at first you don’t succeed, refine and try again.

# Swap Complexity for Clarity
- Confusion is the killer.
	- You can’t make an impact if you’re trying to impress.
- Simplify your language.
	- Be clear, not clever. Concise, not complex.
