# 6 stages of idea development
![[03_Life_experience/Writing_Sharing is caring/Others/6 stages of idea development/Idea development.png]]

## Capture
- The process of collecting the spark of an idea. It could be with a web clipper, your phone's notes app, or in pocket notebook.
- The idea is to reduce friction and make it simple. A lot of us are good at this! Maybe too good, because we don't do the next stage as well.

## Critique 
- Next you critique the initial capture. Here you’re examining how to proceed. Can you use this idea? Does it have potential? Can you add more substance and begin developing this concept?
- Do this within 48 hours of the first capture so the idea is still fresh.

## Customize
- When you customize a note your goal is to ensure it is high-quality, unique, & individual. This helps you create a standalone piece of content, aka an "atomic" note that can live on its own. 
- On the webinar we'll cover my QUICK Note Method to assist with this stage.

## Connect
- Now you’re considering context and relationships here. You’re discerning what sorts of relationships exist between notes & ideas. 
- What you're thinking here is, “As I develop this idea, can I link any others? Do I have any other ideas or notes that naturally connect?”

## Construct
- This is where you start to build. Construction happens when you review your ideas and begin putting everything in order.
- I love the LEGO block analogy, you want the pieces to fit around a single concept like an email newsletter, project kickoff, or sales call.

## Communicate
- Everything should be ready to share with the world or anything that you’re ready to share with another person.
- When you follow the 6 C's of idea development, it means you never have to start from scratch again!  You have a collection of notes to use as material.
