# Embrace Your Obsession

- When people pick a niche, most people aren’t truly obsessed with it so external motivation is required:
	- Forcing yourself to do research
	- Slogging through boring client calls
	- Or another cup of coffee

- Obsession is the opposite
	- You want to do really badly
	- You don't need any goals, habits, systems, discipline, rewards, or any other mental hacks
- **That’s when your work ethic, desire, and discoveries become un-copyable**

# Develop Unique Knowledge
- Unique knowledge is the knowledge that you have acquired on your unique journey, that other people want, but can’t figure out.
- You get rewarded for unique knowledge, not for effort.
	- Effort is required to create unique knowledge.
- James Clear’s obsession with habits led him on a unique journey all his own that create unique knowledge:
	- Habit Stacking
	- Plateau of Latent Potential
	- The 3 layers of Behavioral Change

# Build Distribution By Studying People
- Being obsessed and acquiring specific knowledge is only half of the game.
- To build a business, people must know you exist.
- Study human psychology, marketing, and persuasion.
- **Don’t copy your competitors.**

# Scale Using Compounding, Daily Media
- The internet has unlocked massive scale, unlike anything we’ve ever seen.
- Tell **[stories](https://www.justinwelsh.me/blog/03262022)**, use metaphors, show real word examples, share behind the scenes, challenge conventional thinking, etc.
- Every piece of content works on your behalf for hours, days or even years without any extra effort
