# Editing while writing
- Embrace the idea of a “shitty first draft”
- Get your ideas down (fast) then edit later.

# Worrying about grammar
- “The object of fiction isn’t grammatical correctness but to make the reader welcome and then tell a story.” — Stephen King
- The emotion you elicit is more important than your grammar.

# Not using “you” and “your”
- Address your reader directly – write to an audience of one.
- Check out this paragraph from George RR Martin’s Game of Thrones.
	- He uses “you” everywhere to nail the point, even though the book is from 3rd person POV.

# Writing about features
- Nobody cares about your product’s storage or speed
- Write about the benefits instead – what do the features enable or unlock?

# Ignoring structure
- “Words create sentences; sentences create paragraphs; sometimes paragraphs quicken and begin to breathe.” — Stephen King
- A great example from Gary Provost:

# Sounding too smart
- “One day I will find the right words, and they will be simple.” – Jack Kerouac
- Use <http://hemingwayapp.com> to check what grade level you’re writing for.

# Using the phrase “I think”
- Of course you think it – you wrote it.
- But “I think” makes you seem unsure.

# Overlooking the hook
- Your first sentence or two determines if the reader continues reading.
- It’s the Pareto Principle – 20% of your effort leads to 80% of the outcome.
- In writing, the hook is that 20%.

# Not learning from the best
- “Read everything — trash, classics, good & bad, and see how they do it. Like a carpenter who works as an apprentice studies the master. Read! You’ll absorb it.” — William Faulkner
- If you want to write well, do two things:

	1. Read a lot
	2. Write a lot
