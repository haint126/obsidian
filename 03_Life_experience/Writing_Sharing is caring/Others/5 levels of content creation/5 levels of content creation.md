# 5 levels to content creation:

## Consumption
- To be the best creator you can be, you need purposeful consumption of quality material.

## Curation
- Curation can be basic or advanced.
	- Basic curation is "10 Chrome extensions that will save you 100s of hours"
	- Advanced curation is Ryan Holiday's work with Stoicism.
- It could be 80% stories from historical figures with 20% of his thoughts on the content.

## Obvious content
- Obvious content will often go viral.
- It's the content people already know and easily agree with.
- It's not necessarily content you'll remember in 20, 30 or 50 years, though.
- Think of a title like "The Subtle Art of Not Giving F\*CK".

## Non-Obvious content
- When you first come across non-obvious content your intention may be to scroll past it.
- This is the content that will rarely go viral, but it will stick with you for years.
- It comes from people with a significant depth of knowledge in specific areas.

## Category creation
- Truly successful creators don't write a book, they create a niche.
- They become known for "something" and everything they do touches that.
	- Justin Welsh - SaaS
	- Sahil Bloom - Thinking
	- Ryan Holiday - Stoicism
- They pick a lane, stick to it and make it THEIRs.
