# Here's how a Zettelkasten works:
- Write each idea you come across on a card
- Link idea cards to other relevant idea cards (idea -> idea link)
- Sort cards into broader topic boxes (idea -> topic link)

## Literature notes
- Add useful docs (papers, books) as a literature note
- Metadata includes: #literaturenote tag, source, author
- Summaries content, each key idea as a simple sentence
- Elaborate on each key idea with some bullet points

## Permanent notes
- I then convert key ideas into permanent notes based on:
	- Would I explore this further?
	- Or can I connect this to other ideas?
- Metadata includes: #permanentnote tag, #topic tags, literature note link, relevant permanent notes
- Add summary in prose

## Topics
- This comes free if you've been adding #topic tags
- You can now jump into topics via tags and navigate via links of relevant permanent notes
