# Gary Halbert
- The highest-paid copywriter in history: Gary Halbert.
- And in one of his very last letters, he shared 12 time-tested strategies for writing better copy, faster.

# 1. Set up a proper writing space
- Gary was a big fan of writing anywhere.
	- His desk
	- Local bar
	- Bookstore
	- Coffee shop
- The location didn't matter.
- But he made sure to stick with the same one for long stretches.
- The goal was to signal to his brain "it's time to write."

# 2. Set up a writing routine
- “I write when I’m inspired, so I see to it I’m inspired every morning at nine o’clock.” ~ Peter De Vries
- Time: the first thing you need to write well.
- But the best writers don't find time to write. They make time to write.

## Example
- Gary was big on writing first thing in the morning.
- So before bed, he would scribble down notes on four questions:
	- What's the big idea here?
	- What's my product's biggest benefit?
	- What's most exciting about this product?
	- What emotion am I trying to create.
- Then, he went to bed and let his subconscious do the work for him.
- Like clockwork, he would wake up with a clear answer to each question.

# 3. Write. A LOT.
- Gary says there's no shortcut. And he's right.
- The more you write, and the more often you right, the better you will become.
- Because no one is forever bad at writing.
- They either have 10 and quit, or do it long enough to figure it out.

# 4. Write for set time periods.
- Gary was big on the Pomodoro technique.
- He set a timer for 33:33
	- During this time, he could do anything except getting out of his chair
- -> This took the pressure off writing.
	- Most times he'd stare at the wall, sip his coffee, think many other things
- But then, someway or another, he'd start writing.
- And the timer let him know the torture would end soon.
- During his breaks, he would walk around, have a quick snack, and do anything else but write.
	- And during this time, inspiration always struck.
- => Then, at the end of the day, he wouldn't say to himself "I wrote until I got tired."
	- He would say "I wrote for six sessions today."

# 5. Write something easy, first.
- When Gary wasn't feeling it, he would practice copywork.
- He had a go-to list of great sales letters he would copy word for word to get warmed up.

# 6. Allow yourself to create junk.
- For every great sales letter, Gary wrote 20 crappy sales letters.
- His reminder: "In this history of written communication, nothing has ever been published that is 100% perfect."

# 7. Write your first draft fast and furious with no editing.
- When writing, rip out your backspace button.
- When editing, but it back and rip out everything else.
- Every piece of great writing started as a crappy piece of writing.
- So just get started.

# 8. Don't be afraid to throw away writing if it's no good
- Sometimes, you find your writing is not exactly what you want.
- If you KNOW it's not right, just throw it away
- Even if it is your whole day's effort
- Don't cry or fret over it
- Just start over and keep moving.

# 9. Create an idea capture system
- Gary's system was epic: back in the day, if you wanted to capture an idea on the go, you an 866 number.
- That number would record his call for 60 seconds, then email him a transcription.
- Now, we have many better tools:
	- Notebook
	- Phone
	- Computer

# 10. Get in shape
- To write better copy, faster, you must have the energy
- And you're not going to have that energy unless you exercise and eat fairly well.
- If you start walking 30 minutes a day, three to six days a week, you'll improve your health and energy greatly.
	- Try 5-minute walk first then gradually work your way up

# 11. Specialize in something
- Writers that go nowhere:
	- They try to be everything for everyone on every platform, all the time.
- You need constraints.
	- Time
	- Topic
	- Length
	- Medium
	- Platform
	- Cadence

# 12. Reward yourself
- Humans are simple dopamine chasers.
	- But amateur writers get dopamine from notifications.
	- Professional writers get it from hitting publish.
- The easiest way to do this?
	- Print out a giant calendar.
	- And make a big red X every day you write and publish.
