# TL;DR
- Step 1: Write the body using headers and white space
- Step 2: Use a specific call to action to tell readers what to do.
- Step 3: Write compelling hook lines by using my recommendations

# Biggest mistakes
- Here are the biggest mistakes I see:
	- Lacking a good “Hook Tweet”.
	- No "headers" on the "body" Tweets.
	- Way too wordy, and no white space for reading.
	- No clear call-to-action or call-to-conversation at the end.

# How to write high-quality tweets

## Start by writing the body:
- The body of the thread is the information you're attempting to convey.
- If you're not sharing anything of value, even the best "hook" won't get people to engage, comment, and Retweet.
- Scrolling a thread is tiring, so the format is everything.
 - Each "body" Tweet should:
	- Have a header
		- A header simply tells the reader what to expect in the Tweet they are reading.
	- Include enough white space to make it easy to read
		- White space is the space between lines so that it's easier on the eyes.
- Here's an example of both:

## Write out the call-to-action next:
- So many people write good threads and then forget to tell the reader what to do at the end.
- This is missed opportunity to drive reader action.
- Think about the possible actions you want at the conclusion of your thread and then...
- Tell the reader exactly what they should do:
	- Follow you
	- Join your email list
	- Retweet the first Tweet
	- Read another thread you wrote
	- Buy a product that is relevant to the thread
- Here's an example of how I usually end my threads:

## Finish your writing process by creating your Hook Tweet:
- We're at the last, but most important step of writing Tweet threads.
- The "Hook".
- Without a good hook, nobody stops to read, engage, comment or Retweet. Ouch.

### Here are 3 (of several) hooks that work for me:
- Tell people what they'll get, & address a common objection:

```

- Use eye-catching numbers to share an accomplishment:

```
Today, my little one-person business crossed $3M in revenue.

It took 1,187 days, I ran zero ads & operate at a 94% margin.

Here are the 20 steps of my wild & strange journey:

Hope it's helpful to someone.
```

- Use past vs. present to compare change: (Again, using number's help)

```
I made $0 online in 2019.

3 years later:

- 100M+ impressions
- $1.7M in online income
- 4 successful revenue streams

What changed?

I started writing online every day.

Here's my simple 4-step process.
