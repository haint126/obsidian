# 1. It's missing key takeaways
- Points may be expertly presented, but they're not driven home.

# 2. It leaves out the “why” and “how”
- It’s lacking key contextual information and doesn’t show readers how to fix the problems or pain points raised.

# 3. It doesn’t inject unique insights
- It doesn't
	- Share a unique point of view
	- Mention owned experiences
	- Add something new to the conversation
	- Take a contrarian stance
	- Showcase results.

# 4. It feels like it's written by two people
- For example:
	- You can tell that it was written on different days and that the writer was in a better flow state in the top half of the draft.

# 5. It’s wordy and redundant
- It's full of filler that could have been cut out to make sentences easier to follow and ideas easier to grasp.

# 6. Some sections are way more detailed than others
- The writer over-delivered in certain places (maybe they felt confident or had better luck with research), and seemed to give up in others.

# 7. It doesn't vary sentence length
- It has too many simple sentences. All written like this.
- Or on the flip side, they're too longwinded and take ages to get to the point because they are full of extra words that don't need to be there (like this).

# 8. It includes sweeping generalizations
- It makes big claims but doesn’t back them up with data or examples.

# 9. It has spelling and dialect errors
- Symptoms of not reading it again with a fine tooth comb.

# 10. It has incorrect or outdated sources
- It backs up cited data and statistics, but the sources are old, weak, or interpreted incorrectly.

# 11. It doesn’t follow the content guidelines
- It overlooks preferences (e.g. misuses the Oxford comma or em dashes), misses the mark on the tone of voice (e.g. too conversational or opinionated), and so on.

# 12. The headers don't include outcomes
- It's missing specific outcomes that tell readers what they'll learn from reading (which incentives them to care).

# 13. It doesn't get ahead of objections
- It lacks supplemental info to back up claims, leaving holes in the argument.
