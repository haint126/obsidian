# Sentence structure

## Minimizing complex sentence architecture
- Shorter sentences are
	- Better for general reading comprehension
	- Easier it is to break up big chunks of on-screen text
	- Easier to scan read
- It’s a good rule of thumb to strive for a 10th-grade reading level.

## Mechanics
- Edit out ambiguous modifiers
	- Ambiguous modifiers are misplaced words that could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. 
	- _Incorrect_: While walking on the beach, Kelly found a glittery woman’s dress.
	- _Correct_: While walking on the beach, Kelly found a woman’s glittery dress.
- Eliminate passive voice
	- Always write in active voice
	- This adds greater clarity to writing and sounds more authoritative overall.
	- _Incorrect_: The P&L statement was reviewed by the leadership team.
	- _Correct_: Leadership reviewed the P&L statement. 
- Remove be verb-ing and swap in an active verb
	- _Example_: She could be doing more 
	- _Change to_: She could do more

## Punctuation
A few general tips to keep in mind:

1. **Question marks** make your writing more relatable. By posing questions (rhetorical and otherwise) you can empathize with your audience.
2. **Commas** slow things down. If you need readers to pause, um, use a comma (or two.)
3. **Exclamation points** are phony. Use sparingly. They often (totally!) make you sound fake.
4. **Periods** break things up. If you want to communicate quick, simple thoughts, break down sentences and add more periods.
5. **Em dashes** pause an existing thought. If you need to add something extra or stop the reader for a moment—throw in an em dash. 
6. **Parentheses** add an afterthought. Think of them as your aside with the audience.

### Other notes
- Apostrophes
	- "it's" = "it is" or "it has"
	- "it's" != "its"
	- _Incorrect_: I can’t believe its finally summer.
	- _Correct_: I can’t believe it’s (it is) finally summer.
- Use the plural apostrophe (as in s’) when referring to something that’s owned by a collective/multiple people. 
	- _Ex_: After the storm, the west siders’ homes were destroyed.
- Use apostrophe s (as in ‘s) when expressing an individual's ownership. 
	- _Ex_: Katie’s books got soaked in the rain.
- Punctuation stays INSIDE quotations (if you’re in the US.)
	- _Incorrect_: “The most important rule of writing”, Sam said, “is to be specific”.
	- _Correct_: “The most important rule of writing,” Sam said, “is to be specific.” 
- Comma splices
	- When a comma is used to break up two independent clauses, there should be a conjunction between them. Without one, it’s a comma splice. Fix it by using a period instead of a comma or by dropping in a conjunction.
	- _Incorrect_: The house is $150,000, I want to buy it.
	- _Correct_: The house is $150,000. I want to buy it.
		- OR The house is $150,000, and I want to buy it.

## Common grammar/usage mistakes
- Refer to people as “who” not “that.” 
	- Ex: Sarah is the woman WHO always is running late (not the woman THAT always is running late.)
- Irregardless
	- Not a word. You mean ‘regardless’.
- “I could care less”
	- By writing this, you’re actually telling someone you don’t care much, but you could care a little less than you do in that moment.
	- You mean to write: “I couldn’t care less.”
- Per say vs. per se
	- Close, but no cigar. You mean to write ‘per se’, which means ‘in itself’ in Latin.
- Piece of mind
	- While you can always give someone a piece of your mind, in this instance, you mean peace of mind to indicate serenity.
- Segway vs. segue
	- Segway is the stand up scooter.
	- When you’re talking about transitioning from point A to B, you mean to write segue.
- Free reign vs. free rein
	- Reign is what royalty does (so it kind of makes sense), but you probably mean rein, which is what one does to restrain a horse.
	- When you’re talking about giving someone the ability to roam free, that’s the horse reference--so use rein.
- Throws vs. throes
	- If you’re in the throws of passion, you’re probably in a physical fight.
	- But if you’re in the throes of passion, you’re having an all-consuming emotional experience.
- Here's some
	- This is a phrase I see fairly commonly, as in, "Here's some tips on how to better clean your carpets."
	- But this is incorrect, because "here's" means "here is." The correct use is "Here are some," because you're referring to multiple tips, which constitutes "are" in place of "is."
- Compliment vs. complement
	- Even though these words have different meanings, I often see them both used to mean, "to go well with." But here's the difference: 
		- Compliment refers to praise, as in, "I complimented him on his work ethic." 
		- Complement means to pair nicely with, as in, "The marketing materials complemented the company branding."
- I.e. versus e.g.
	- These abbreviations are often used interchangeably, but in reality, they have different meanings.
		- i.e. is Latin for id est, which means "that is" (like "in essence")
		- while e.g. means exempli gratia, which means "for example." 
	- Use i.e. to summarize an idea and e.g. to list examples.
- BONUS: Quick and easy ways to remember how to spell things right on the first try
	- Dessert vs. desert: Which one do you want more of? That’s the one with a double ‘s’.
	- Accommodate: This word can accommodate a double 'c' and a double 'm'
	- Misspell: Miss Pell never misspells

## Vocabulary
- Swap out overused words in your writing, and don't use five words to say something when you could've used one. Flex your vocabulary and dig for a replacement word that retains the meaning.
	- Anecdoche - A conversation in which everyone is talking, but no one is listening.
	- Anodyne - Not likely to provoke dissent or offense; inoffensive, often deliberately so.
	- Captious - Nitpicking; liable to find fault.
	- Concinnity - The skillful and harmonious arrangement or fitting together of the different parts of something.

	- Insipid - Dull; lacking qualities that excite, interest or stimulate.
	- Lacuna - A gap or absent part, as in a manuscript or logical argument; a hiatus.

- These are just a few fun ones I thought were worth sharing, but the message here is: Don’t let boring words get you down.
