# TLDR
1. Great writing is a byproduct of your daily action
	- Build the writing system that makes great writing inevitable.
2. Start writing now
3. Don't write for everyone, be specific and pinpoint your one ideal readers
4. Think of your writing like a startup
5. Remove anything that is not copywriting
6. Write about 2 things:
	1. Obvious now but not 2 years ago
	2. Confusing now but wanted to master
7. Writing != Editing

	2. Editing is finetuning your idea
8. Write for someone 1 step behind you
9. Be creative and capture your idea anytime and everywhere
10. Writing is the best tool for personal growth
11. **Be clear, not clever**
	- Clever -> Confusion

# 1. The best writing is not a result
- It's a byproduct of:
	- Daily consistency
	- Taking long walks
	- Blocking the internet
	- Capturing ideas everywhere
	- Reading high-quality sources
	- Spending time without my phone
- Build the writing system that makes great writing inevitable.

# 2. There will never be a perfect time to start writing
- The "Once I ... then I'll start writing" is the ultimate form of procrastination.
- -> Get started today.

# 3. When writing, stop trying to write something to everyone
- Instead, be specific and pinpoint your one ideal reader.
	- Use specific examples
	- Solve a specific problem
	- Unlock a specific benefit
	- Create a specific emotion
	- Encourage a specific action

# 4. Stop thinking of it as "writing"
- Instead, start thinking of your writing like a startup.
	- Ship an MVP
	- Talk to users
	- Prioritize distribution
	- Solve specific problems
	- Focus on reader experience
	- Say something different, not better
- The best part: you're the CEO.

# 5. Copywriting is simple
- If any of your copy doesn't fall into one of these 3 buckets, cut it.
	- Point out a specific problem
	- Point out the specific benefits of solving it
	- Position your product as the obvious solution

# 6. You should write about 2 things
- You should write about 2 things
	- Things that are obvious to you now, but weren't 2 years ago
	- Things that are confusing to you now, but you want to better understand in 2 years
- The first thing builds credibility while the other is a push for continuous learning

# 7. Writing and editing are different processes.
- "Writing" is all addition - getting raw material out of your head and onto a page.
	- In this stage, rip out your backspace button.
- "Editing" is all subtraction.
	- In this stage, put your backspace key back and rip out everything else.

# 8. You don't have to be an expert to write about something.
- In fact, people struggle to learn from experts (because they're too far ahead).
- It's easier to learn from someone just 1 step ahead of you.

# 9. If you want to write consistently, you need to capture ideas.
- If you want to write consistently, you need to capture ideas.
- Everywhere.
	- Quick capture on your phone
	- Whiteboards in the shower
	- Notebooks all over the place
- Once your mind trusts you can have ideas anywhere, it's free to be creative - and you'll soon be overwhelmed.

# 10. If your goal is to accelerate your personal growth, writing is the most effective tool.
- Clearer thinking
- New friendships
- Daily consistency
- Learning new topics
- Increased awareness
- Foundational skill you can apply anywhere

# 11. Be clear, not clever.
- Your attempts to be clever lead to nothing but confusion.
- And the second your reader is confused, they're back to TikTok and Netflix.
