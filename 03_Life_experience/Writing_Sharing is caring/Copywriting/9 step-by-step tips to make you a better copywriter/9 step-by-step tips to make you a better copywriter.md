	- Using different sentence lengths

# 2.Write below a 5th grade level.
- The best thinkers (and writers) express complex ideas simply.
- I use http://hemingwayapp.com to make sure my writing is simple.
- Clear > clever


# 3. Seek out great copywriting.

- Study the word choice and structure of great writers by copying, word for word, their work. Do it by hand.
- [@thesamparr](https://twitter.com/thesamparr)’s Copy That is a good place to [start](https://trycopythat.com/).
- I did the same technique with an entire Neil Gaiman book (Stardust).


# 4. Look at customer reviews.
- The best way to connect with customers is to sound like customers.
- Simple hack:
	- Look at your positive reviews, find the common language.
	- Look at negative reviews of competitors' products, find the common language.
	- Incorporate both into your copy.


# 5. Address an individual.
- Use “you,” “your,” and “we” to make your writing more personal.
- Your pages will convert better, your emails will avoid spam, and your audience will enjoy your content more.


# 6. Nobody cares about your features.
- They only care about the benefits to them.
- Aim for 80%+ of your writing to be about how the other person benefits.


# 7. Write for scanners.
- 80% of you will only read the headline.
- That’s not a bad thing.
- But it means your headline should summarize most of the value.


# 8. Tell a story.
- You can use all the tricks you want
- But if you don’t show your audience they can go from X (before) to Y (desired state)
- Then the quality of your copywriting doesn’t matter.

# 9. Write with an eraser.

- If your first draft is 1000 words, the second should be 800.
- Aim to eliminate 20% of words (or more) when editing.
- Why?
- Maximizing the value per word is the best way to grow your credibility and respect other people’s time.
