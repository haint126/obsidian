# 6. Avoid “landing page words”

- Real people don't use them.

# 12. More periods, fewer commas.
- Periods mean short sentences. We like short sentences.
- Commas mean long, painful sentences, like this one, which New Yorker writers think are clever, but real people find torturous, because they wind on and on without actually saying anything.

# 13. Kill adverbs. Kill adjectives.
- They're flowery. They're vague. They try too hard:

# 14. Think slippery slide
- Every line of copy should lead to the next.

- Go to the edge:

# 16. Your first line is crucial
- If people don’t read it, they’re not going to read your second line either.
- Keep it short:
![[03_Life_experience/Writing_Sharing is caring/Copywriting/17 tips for great copywriting/First line.png]]

# 17. Copywriting is selling
- Don’t romanticize it. The goal isn't to be clever or cute.
- The goal is to inspire action:
