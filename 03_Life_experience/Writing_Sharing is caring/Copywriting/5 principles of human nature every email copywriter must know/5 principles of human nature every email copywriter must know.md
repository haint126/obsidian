# 1. Self-interest
- People are inherently selfish
	- They don’t care about you or your product, they care about what it can do for them.
- When writing your emails:
	- Make the reader the focus
	- Focus on the benefits of the product
	- Illustrate clearly how their life will improve

# 2. Curiosity
- Our innate need to close loops & make sense of the world has been the driving force of human behavior since the dawn of time.
- To use curiosity properly, here are 2 psychological triggers you can apply today:

## A) Challenging beliefs
- When you challenge a common belief, you create disorder in the reader's mind which keeps their attention as they search for the explanation.
- For example:
	- People believe that being intelligent gives them an advantage when it comes to making money.
	- So a subject line like “Why people with 85 IQ are making double your income” would probably crush because it directly violates what they believe to be true.

## B) Creating an “information gap”
- Compartmentalization is the enemy of great copy.
	- If the reader thinks they know what you’re going to say, they won’t click the email let alone keep reading.
- To avoid this, create information gaps in your SL & body copy.

# 3. Simplicity
- The more people understand what you’re saying, the easier it is for them to keep reading & take action.
- Apply this principle to your emails by:
	- Editing ruthlessly
	- Optimizing your message for clarity
	- Giving clear instructions for what you want them to do

# 4. Emotional Appeals
- Humans are emotional creatures, we’re inherently drawn to anything that makes us feel something.
- We’re also more likely to take action in an emotional state
- The 2 best ways to create emotion are

## A) Knowing your reader
- When you understand what pain points/desires will trigger your readers, you can subtly weave them into your copy.

## B) Storytelling
- We love stories because they engage our emotions
	- Learn to craft one properly & then use them to deliver your message.

# 5. Consistency
- People have an innate desire to act in a way that’s consistent with their beliefs & values.
- Why?
	- Because it’s easier to make one decision & stick with it than to constantly reassess how we view the world.
	- It’s a filtering mechanism that lies deep within us all.
- This is another reason why you NEED to know your readers.
	- When you understand what beliefs & values they hold, you can show them in your copy how buying your product is simply an extension of those beliefs & values.
		- Much easier than trying to change their worldview
