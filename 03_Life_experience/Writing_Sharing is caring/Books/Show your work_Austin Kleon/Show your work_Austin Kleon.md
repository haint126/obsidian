# 0. A new way of operating

- If you just focus on getting really good, people will come to you
- In order to be found, you have to be *findable*
- By *showing* your work, you can spending the majority of your time, energy and attentions doing your stuff while also possibly attract a group of people who share your interests
- People who have built *sharing* into their routine are open about what they’re working on, and they are consistently posting bits and pieces of their work, their ideas, and what they are learning online
- By generously sharing their ideas and their knowledge, they often gain an audience that they can then leverage when they need it—for fellowship, feedback, or patronage


# 1. You don't have to be a genius

## Find a scenius

- "**Lone genius**" myth is one of destructive myths about creativity:
	- An individual with superhuman talents appears out of nowhere, thinks of new ideas and creates those masterpiece all by himself.
	- In this belief, creativity is an *antisocial* act, performed by only a few great figures
	- The rest of us are left to stand around and gawk in awe at their achievements
- "Scenius" is a healthier way of thinking about creativity:
	- Under this model, great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals who make up an "ecology of talent"
	- If you look back closely at history, many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were actually part of a scenius
	- A Scenius can be a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other’s work, copying from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas.
- The idea of scenius makes room in the story of creativity for *the rest of us*: the people who don’t consider ourselves geniuses
	- Being a valuable part of a scenius is not necessarily about how smart or talented you are, but about what you have to contribute:
		- The ideas you share
		- The quality of the connections you make
		- The conversations you start
	- From there, we can stop asking what others can do for us, and start asking what we can do for others

## Be an amateur 

- Amateurs are the enthusiasts who pursue their work in the spirit of love
- Because they have little to lose, amateurs are willing to try anything, be open about their learning and share the results
- Sometimes, in the process of doing things in an unprofessional way, they make new discoveries
- Doing things in mediocre way is better than doing nothing
- Amateurs are not afraid to make mistakes or look ridiculous in public
- Sometimes, amateurs have more to teach us than experts: Fellow students can help one another more than the master
- The world is changing at such a rapid rate that it’s turning us all into amateurs

- The best way to start sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others.
	- Find a scenius
	- Pay attention to what others are sharing
	- Start taking note of what they’re not sharing
	- Try to fill out the voids with your own efforts, no matter how bad they are
	- Be an amateur
	- Share what you love, and the people who love the same things will find you.

## You can't find your voice if you don't use it

- Talk about the things you love, your voice will follow.
- If you want people to know about what you do and the things you care about, you have to share

## Read obituaries

- Thinking about your inevitable end can change your perspective of everything
- Reading obituaries is a way to experience near-death
- Obituaries aren’t really about death, they’re about life
- Reading about dead people's achievements can make you start doing something decent
- Thinking about death makes you want to live





# 2. Think process, not product
## Take people behind the scene
- Traditionally,
	- What matter to the viewers is the product
	- What matter to the  is the process
	- The process is almost never visible or even knowable in the product
- Today, using Internet and social media, the artist can share her work and herself
- Audiences not only want to stumble across great work, but they, too, long to be creative and part of the creative process.
- The artist sharing her process allows the audience to have ongoing connections with her and her work, which in turn help her back

## Become a documentarian of what you do
- . In fact, sharing your process might actually be most valuable if the products of your work aren’t easily shared, if you’re still in the apprentice stage of your work, if you can’t just slap up a portfolio and call it a day, or if your process doesn’t necessarily lead to tangible finished products.
