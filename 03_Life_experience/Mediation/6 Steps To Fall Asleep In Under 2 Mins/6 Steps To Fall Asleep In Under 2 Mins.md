# Opening
- This method is created by the US navy pre-flight school
- It took about 6 weeks of practice

# 1. Relax your entire face, including the muscles inside your mouth

# 2. Drop your shoulders to release the tension and let your hands drop to the sides of your body

# 3. Exhale, relaxing your chest

# 4. Relax your legs, thighs and calves

# 5. Clear your mind for 10 seconds by imagining a relaxing scene.
- For example, you are lying in a canoe on a calm lake with nothing but a clear blue sky above you

# 6. If this does not work, try saying the words "don't think" over and over for 10 seconds
- Within 10 seconds, you should fall asleep
