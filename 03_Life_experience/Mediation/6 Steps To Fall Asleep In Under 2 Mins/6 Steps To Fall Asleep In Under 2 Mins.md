# Opening
- This method is created by the US navy pre-flight school
- It took about 6 weeks of practice

# 1. Relax your entire face, including the muscles inside your mouth
- Close your eyes.
- Breathe slowly and deeply.
- Then slowly relax all your face muscles.
- Relax
	- Your Jaws
	- Your cheeks
	- Your mouth
	- Your tongue
	- Your everything
	- Your eyes

# 2. Drop your shoulders to release the tension and let your hands drop to the sides of your body
- Let go of any tension.
- Relax your neck, your traps; feel yourself sinking into the chair or bed.
- Then start at top of your right arm, and slowly relax your biceps, forearms, and hands.
- Repeat on the other side.
- And don't forget to keep breathing slowly and deeply.

# 3. Exhale, relaxing your chest

# 4. Relax your legs, thighs and calves
- Start with your right thigh; let it sink into chair or bed.
- Then do the same with your calf, ankle and foot.
- Repeat the process with your left leg.

# 5. Clear your mind for 10 seconds by imagining a relaxing scene.
- Granted, it's hard not to think about anything (I end up thinking about not thinking about anything.)
- If that's you, try holding an image in your mind.
	- Choose something relaxing.
		- For example, you are lying in a canoe on a calm lake with nothing but a clear blue sky above you
	- Picture yourself lying comfortably in darkness.

# 6. If this does not work, try saying the words "don't think" over and over for 10 seconds
- Within 10 seconds, you should fall asleep
- If nothing else, that should help distract you from thinking about whatever it is that might otherwise keep you awake.
