# TLDR
- To rebuild my real estate portfolio to $10 million, I'd focus on:
	- Value add
	- House hack
	- Buy for appreciation
	- Target the right location:
		 - Product type
		 - Relative location
		 - Specific location
		 - Path of progress
	- Refinance and repeat

# Start Sooner
- Your time in the market will beat your ability to time the market.

# Control Your Spending
- One of the biggest mistakes people make is increasing their lifestyle as they earn more.
- If I had to do it all over again, I'd cap my lifestyle sooner, because the additional cash unlocks:
	- More acquisitions
	- Greater compounding

# Value Add
- Whatever you buy, make sure you can add value:
	- Renovation
	- Home extension
	- Add a separate building
- The goal is to be able to refinance after you add value to finance your next acquisition.

# House Hack
- If you're starting from scratch, buy the maximum home you can afford.
- Live in one bedroom of a house and rent out the other three bedrooms.

# Buy for Appreciation
- People tell you cash flow is the way to go and that it will supercharge your portfolio.
- They're wrong.
- Instead, I'd invest in assets that appreciate, which gives you the power to leverage into more investments.
- Leverage is our goal.

# Be Prepared
- Leverage is your friend when the market is hot.
- It can sink you when the market drops.
- Interest rates will rise and they will fall.
- You need to be prepared and have sufficient cash reserves.
- This is when most people run scared.
- Soon, this will be when to buy.

# Target the Right Location:
- They say location is everything for real estate.
- They're right.
- Focus on these factors for location:
	- Product type
	- Relative location
	- Specific location
	- Path of progress
	- Product type
- There are three product types I look at:
	- Condos
	- Townhomes
	- Single-family homes
- They usually move within tight bands.
- If condos get too high in price, investors flip to townhomes.
- Pay attention to price asymmetry over time by type.

# Relative Location
- In most cities, there are certain geographic regions.
- For example:
	- Urban core
	- Suburban center
	- Outer suburban sprawl
- Pay attention to the price movement in the three relative areas over time.
- Target the areas with lowest recent relative growth.

# Specific Location
- Once you've chosen urban core, suburban centers or the outer suburban sprawl, pick the specific location, focus on:
	- Shops
	- Schools
	- Walkability
	- Restaurants
	- Transportation
	- Nearby amenities
- Target the specific area you would want to live.

# Path of Progress
- The path of progress is key to it all.
- It is how you'll add max value, which you can lever into your next buy.
- The path of progress is spotting gentrification before it happens.
- It is being in the hot market before it's hot.
- It provides the most "lift".
- How to spot the path of progress:
	- Walk an area
	- Talk to the locals
	- talk to the developers
	- Where are future transit routes
	- Where do the hipsters & artists live
	- Map out the migration of gentrification
	- If the “West Side” is hot, how far East does it go each year

# Refinance and Repeat
- After doing the above, you should have lift in your home.
- Next, refinance the home.
- Use the equity that you've generated to buy your next property.
- Rinse and repeat the exercise, following these steps, until you've built your portfolio.

# The Power of Compounding
- It took me many years to realize compounding is what matters.
- The more assets you own, through leverage, the greater the returns will be over the long term.
- Just focus on growing your asset base and let compounding take care of the rest.
