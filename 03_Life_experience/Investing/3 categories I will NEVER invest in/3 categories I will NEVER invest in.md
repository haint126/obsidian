# 1. ATM Routes
- Why?
	- Margins = small
	- Payback period = long
	- Future of industry = questionable
- Location is key with ATMs, and at the end of the day… It’s just not worth it.

# 2. Fulfillment By Amazon
- IG is flooded with “hey girl!”s wondering if you want to make a passive $20k/mo with FBA.
- MLM vibes. Just say no, kids.
	- Amazon can ban your account = say bye to your biz
	- Me-too products = unbeatable competition
	- Amazon sets prices = no control

# 3. Retail Stores
- Your competition is:
	- Giant corporations
	- Mom & pop stores funded by rich people as a defective side project
- Industry isn’t recovered from the pandemic and supply chain mess
- Need HIGH volume to make a profit
- High turnover (of product AND staff)
- Decent traffic = high rent
