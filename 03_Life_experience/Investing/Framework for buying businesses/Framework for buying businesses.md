# Goal
- Finding the businesses that have:
	- Lowest risk
	- Profitability
	- A reasonable price
	- Potential for growth
	- Simple (not easy) execution

# Framework SOWS
- SOWS stands for:
	- Stale
	- Old
	- Weak
	- Simple

## 1. Stale
- Half the businesses in your hometown fit.
- The place runs okay, but:
	- No testimonials
	- Website from 2005
	- Limited social media
	- Still use a fax machine
- This leaves a lot of room for easy innovation when you buy...
- AND you don't price that into the purchase.

## 2. Old
- Businesses that have existed for 5 years+
- If you want cashflow...
- Give me a 25-year-old car wash over a startup run by 25-year-olds any day.
- The Lindy Effect says if it's existed for some time it will likely continue to exist.
- Old biz’s can be hidden gems.

## 3. Weak
- Buy a biz with poor competition.
- When was the last time you got a plumber:
	- On time
	- With automated billing
	- Who sent follow-up texts?
- There are 3 easy fixes right there to make you better than competitors.

## 4. Simple
- Simple business model.
- Simple operations.
- If you can easily explain your first few deals to an 8-year-old, you’re on the right track.
