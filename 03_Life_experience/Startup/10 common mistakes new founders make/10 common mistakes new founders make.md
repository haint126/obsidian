# 1. Focusing way too much on hiring
- There is a fallacy that trips up even the best entrepreneurs.
	- “More people leads to more output”
- Here’s a fact:
	- An All-In team of 5 can out-execute a normal team of 20 any day of the week.

# 2. Waiting until it’s too late to launch
- Many founders avoid launching as long as they can.
	- But this is a big mistake.
- You need real user input ASAP.
	- Great founders launch Alphas, Betas, and get real people using the product day one.
- Get it live, refine after.

# 3. Outsourcing sales before knowing how to sell
- Founders should always do the first 10-100 sales.
- After you know HOW to sell, only then can you can build a playbook and decide WHO to hire.
- Skipping this step is avoiding a problem.
	- Don’t avoid problems, charge at them head-on.

# 4. Banking on the VC check
- You have a VC interested in your company.
- But you should assume it’s a NO until the wire hits your bank account.
- Continue to build the company as-if no money is coming in.
- Continue to talk to other investors too

# 5. Bringing on the wrong cofounder
- Bringing on a cofounder is THE most important decision you can make.
- And yet, so many mess up.
	- This can ruin your company before it even has a chance.
- The good news. a smart approach can keep you safe.

# 6. Thinking you need an “adult in the room”
- We all get imposter syndrome.
	- YES you need seasoned people to give you advice.
	- NO you don’t need to give them control of your company.
- Don't give up board seats or copious equity, to someone who tells you that you need them.

# 7. Getting governance wrong
- Corporate governance is hard, and you need to learn it in-and-out.
- The longer you take to get it right, the harder it is to change.
- Set things up the right way, day one.

# 8. Broadcasting that you’re fundraising before you’re ready
- It’s really tough to recover from a failed fundraise.
- Especially if your network knows you failed.
- Do the prep work EARLY, and make sure your relationships are warm before telling the world you’re raising.

# 9. Not setting company values
- Imperfect values is always better than no values.
- Create a list of 4-10 values that everyone knows.
	- Start somewhere so your team has a framework for how they should operate as one team.
- Be open to iteration and change.
- How?
	- If you want to learn more about getting culture right, consider taking the Conscious Culture Pledge.
	- And a ton more resources are available at [conscious.org](https://conscious.org/)

# 10. Focusing on operating and forgetting on product
- So many founders get obsessed with running the company.
	- Team, culture, operations, fundraising, strategy.
- But they forget to build an amazing product too.
- Your product is the heart of your company.
	- It gives it life.
