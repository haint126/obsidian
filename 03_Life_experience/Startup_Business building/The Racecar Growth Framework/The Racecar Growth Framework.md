# The Racecar Growth Framework
![[03_Life_experience/Startup_Business building/The Racecar Growth Framework/The Racecar Growth Framework.jpg]]

- This image includes
	- components of how your startup grows
	- the most popular tactics within each component
- I encourage you to use this as a source of inspiration for your growth ideation

## When to focus on each component
- When you’re just starting out, focus your energy on Kickstarts, and maybe a few Turbo boosts, until your Growth engine begins to drive the majority of your growth. [[03_Life_experience/Startup_Business building/The Racecar Growth Framework/Consumer GTM Worksheet|Here’s a template to help you plan your GTM]].
- Once you have a working Growth engine, invest in Lubricants to help it run more efficiently, and the occasional Turbo boost to boost growth.
- Once you’re at a meaningful scale, explore one or two Mid-stage accelerants.
- Before your primary engine asymptotes, experiment with and kickstart an additional Growth engine, while continuing to Lubricate your existing growth engine(s).
- To continue growing, layer on an additional business unit, expand to new segments (e.g. enterprise), and grow within existing accounts (e.g. increase NRR).

# The Racecar Growth Framework—Expanded

## 1. The Growth Engine
- The growth engine is a self-sustaining growth loop that drives nearly all your growth long-term.
- Of all the components, the growth engine is the most important
	- It’s the only component that can be self-sustaining—creating an output (e.g. revenue) that can then be reinvested into more growth (e.g. ads).
- There are four common growth engines:
	1. SEO: You (or your users) create content → People discover your content while searching (e.g. Google, YouTube, TikTok, etc.) → They become users → More users leads to more content
	2. Paid ads: You run ads online (e.g. FB, AdWords, YouTube), OOH (e.g. billboards, buses), or in-home (e.g. direct mail, TV, podcasts) → Ads drive users → Users generate revenue → Revenue is used to run more ads
	3. Sales: You hire salespeople → Salespeople get customers → Customers drive revenue → Revenue is used to hire more salespeople
	4. Virality: User signs up → User enjoys product and shares product with other people (either through word of mouth, inviting their friends through your product, sharing content from the app, or incentivized referrals) → Friend signs up and shares it with their friends
- In the B2C list, you’ll notice there’s one additional growth engine, “Supply driving demand.”
	- This can be thought of as an incredibly powerful growth engine
	- But it won’t be the source of your growth, because you still need to grow the supply in the first place (usually through sales)
	- [Read more about this engine here](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/i/57395431/supply-driving-demand).

## 3. Turbo boosts
- Turbo boosts are one-off events that accelerate growth temporarily but don’t last.
- There’s some overlap with kickstarts
- The difference is
	- Kickstarts are effective for getting you started (e.g. not scalable, scrappy, low investment)
	- Turbo boosts can accelerate growth at any point.
