# 1. Start with internal drive
- Money won't keep you focused.
- Notoriety won't help you solve hard problems.
- You need internal drive for the problem you're solving.
- This will keep you focused, determined, and energized.

# 2. Solve difficult problems
- The world's best companies are based on hard problems.
- They seek to do the impossible and make a massive impact.
- If your business tackles a hard problem:
	- Hiring will be easier
	- Company impact will be higher
	- Marketing will be more effective

# 3. Create something useful
- Never build a company just because you can.
- That is not an adequate validation of your idea.
- Seek to build something truly helpful to your market.
- Ask yourself what the market really needs, then go deliver.
- No more "just because" companies.

# 4. Build a timeless product
- Aim to build a product that:
	- Creates generational wealth
	- Helps your market for decades
	- Has the ability to evolve and get better
- Big, timeless ideas are more fun to build than trends.
- And the payout is almost always higher.

# 5. Establish systems to compound effort
- When you start a company, you run:
	- Operations
	- Marketing
	- Finances
	- Strategy
	- Product
	- Etc
- Build repeatable systems for everything you can.
- You'll thank yourself later when you need to hire.

# 6. Chase the highest leverage projects
- Ask yourself:
- "What is the highest leverage project I can do this week?"
- Then break it down into manageable tasks.
- Sort those subtasks by highest leverage as well.
- Working on the right things is just as important as the amount of hours.

# 7. Hire a small but exceptional team
- You don't need to hire 100s of people right away.
- But you do need an elite starting team.
- Look for people who:
	- Have a growth mindset
	- Believe in the mission
	- Are autonomous
	- Solve problems
	- Enjoy feedback
	- Like hard work

# 8. Make over-communication the default
- Mediocre communication kills good companies.
- No one knows as much about the projects as you.
- Never assume they don't need the details.
- Over-communicate, stay close to your inbox, respond to all messages.
- This sets the tone for others.

# 9. Don't hesitate to change course
- Sometimes a small project doesn't work out.
- Sometimes the whole company doesn't.
- Be ruthless in your analysis of company health.
- Identify opportunities to salvage where possible.
- Otherwise, cut ties and make new plans.

# 10. Fear only what can kill you
- Identify the biggest threats to your business:
	- Market dynamics
	- Monetization
	- Retention
	- Etc
- Combat these at all costs with solutions.
- Treat all remaining problems as non-threatening.

# 11. Don't take advice from non-builders
- So much advice out there.
- But most is not from credible sources.
- Ignore "tips and tricks" from people who haven't done this before.
- They are trying to help, but they don't really know how.
- Seek advice from proven doers and leaders.

# 12. Massive outcomes flow from taking risks
- You'll never build a billion dollar company without making a lot of tough calls.
- Identifying the right risks to take is a superpower.
- If you hit on 2-3 big risks, your company can skyrocket.
- Never take the chance and you'll stagnate.

# 13. Improve the quantity and quality of your relationships
- The people you meet will determine:
	- Who you can hire
	- Who will fund your company
	- Who will pay for your product
	- Who will advocate and market for you
- Relationship-building is half the job of a founder.
