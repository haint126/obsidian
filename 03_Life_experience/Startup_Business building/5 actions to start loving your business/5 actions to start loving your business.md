# Situation
- Building a business can make you wealthy with both time and money.
- But it can also feel like a self-imposed prison sentence.
- Be intentional with what you're building and you'll get the results you want.

# Optimize customer roster:
- Every 6 months rank your customers from top to bottom.
- Identify commonalities amongst the top and replicate, while firing bottom tier customers.
- It's scary to fire customers, but it's liberating and your bottom line will thank you for your courage.

# Productize:
- Taking on any customer who is willing to pay is the fast track to misery.
- Instead, craft an offer that is designed for the perfect customer and that's who you'll attract.
- Future bad customers will haggle on price and terms.
- That's your sign to move on fast!

# Put yourself first:
- => Reduce unnecessary spends
- I've talked to 100s of entrepreneurs who can't figure our why revenue doesn't flow to the bottom line.
- They have large teams, expensive subscriptions, etc.
- It's all BS -- bake owner's compensation into expenses from day 1.
- It's the most important one...

# Low leverage:
- Avoid taking on unnecessary debt.
- It usually ends up creating long term cash flow issues and cranks up the stress 10x.
- Even though it's enticing to see cash available in your account, it's really just stealing from future earnings.
- Slow and steady wins.

# Sales volume:
- Struggling owners are rarely doing enough sales outreach.
- Backend dashboards, custom software, even accounting can all wait.
- NONE of it matters without consistent sales, so get out there and let everyone know about your offer.
- Rule: 10x your sales effort.
