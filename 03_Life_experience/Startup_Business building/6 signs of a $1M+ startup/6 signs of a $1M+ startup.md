# TLDR
- How to identify $1M+ startup opportunities (quickly):
	1. You have demand before building
	2. Existing “Okay” products can survive
	3. You retain users
	4. Your product grows organically
	5. People would miss your product
	6. You can make 3x your acquisition costs

# The signs
- The success of your startup depends on how hungry the market is.
	- Meaning your customers:
		- Buy
		- Consistently use
		- And tell others about your product
- If it’s yes to all 4 of these, you’ve found a profitable opportunity.
	1. Is there a problem your product can solve?
	2. Is the problem urgent?
	3. Do the customers in said market have money?
	4. Is the market willing to pay to solve that problem?

# 1) You have demand before building
- Tesla’s Cyber truck hasn’t begun production yet.
	- Yet 1.3 million people have already placed orders.
- The lesson?
	- Find a market with demand, then build the product.

# 2) An “okay” product can survive
- LinkedIn restricts users from commenting on posts after 100 comments that day.
	- Limiting its users networking experience.
	- Still, 800 million people use LinkedIn.
- If your half-baked product can survive, you’ve found a profitable opportunity.

# 3) You retain users
- If users are staying, you’ve found a hungry market.
- Important note:
	- It’s impossible to retain all customers.
	- The key is to retain customers who need your product.
- If you only lose <2% of customers per month, you’re doing good.

# 4) Your product grows organically
- When people love your product, they’ll recommend it to others.
- Ex) It costs $10 to acquire a customer.
	- That customer tells 10 friends and 5 of them buy.
	- $10 = 6 customers.
- When people spread the word, you save big on marketing.

# 5) People would miss your product
- Send this survey to your customers:
	- What would you feel if you could no longer use product x?
		- a) Nothing
		- b) Disappointed
		- c) Very disappointed
- If >45% answer c, you have a decent product market fit.

# 6) You can make 3x your acquisition costs
- SaaS example:
	- The cost of acquiring a new customer = $20
	- Your SaaS offers a $10 /mo subscription.
	- You retain for 8 months at $10 = $80
	- You’ve paid $20 to make $80.
	- More than 3x what you’ve paid.
- Product market fit.
