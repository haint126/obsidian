- Money - your work should make them more money.
- Time - your work should free up their time.
- Status - your work should make them look good.

- Learn how to talk about these things.

# 2. Charging by the hour punishes you for being good at your job.

- Certainty: Show them how you get repeatable results.

# 8. In our personal lives, it's taboo to talk about money.
- But there's a paradox...
	- In business, "Those who can't talk about money, don't make it."
