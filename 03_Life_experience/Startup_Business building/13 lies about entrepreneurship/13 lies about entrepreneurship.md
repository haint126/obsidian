	- Strategy comes first then execution
- Failing is not always good
	- It only good if you can bounce back

- Solve a meaningful problem then fall in love with the process
- Find BIG problems, whether it exists yet or not
- Great Companies create their own luck
- Not every advices are good
- Slow and Steady loses the Race
- No Side Hustle
- It’s never Too Late to Start
- Stop waiting time on a clearly bad project
- Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is not always right

## Action
- Strategy -> Execution
- Find best ideas which are:
	- Monetizable
	- Quick to build
	- Obviously useful
	- Pushes society forward
- Solve a meaningful problem then fall in love with the process later
- The big problems might not visible to the naked eyes, try finding them
- Create your own luck
- Apply advices selectively
- Time is enemy
- Be all in, or all out.
- Start now
- Pivot if it is clearly not working
- Find where Efficient Market Hypothesis is wrong

# Execution is Everything
- Strategy has its place.
- If you execute before you know your direction, you'll hit the wrong target.
- Figure these out quickly:
	- Product Direction
	- Long-term Vision
	- Company Goals
	- #1 Team
- Then go execute rapidly.

# Failing is Good
- Experiments are a crucial part of building a company.
- But a failed experiment still costs.
	- And failing to pivot quickly can compound over time.
- Never settle for failure as an acceptable outcome.

# Jobs Are Safer than Entrepreneurship
- Entrepreneurship is the only way to put your future in your own hands.
- Own a company, or be owned by a company.

# Good Idea = Good Company
- The best idea does NOT always win.
- It's usually the idea that shares these traits:
	- Monetizable
	- Quick to build
	- Obviously useful
	- Pushes society forward
- Lots of ideas are better in thought than reality

# Do What You Love
- Don't follow a passion, follow a problem.
- You'll develop passion over time working on meaningful projects.
- Attempt to improve the world around you, and you'll find more joy than anyone following a small "passion".

# Solve Existing Problems
- The greatest ideas in history were built on problems we didn't know existed.
	- No one thought horses needed an upgrade, until cars came around.
	- People laughed at EV cars, now they're the standard.
- Find BIG problems, whether it exists yet or not.

# Great Companies get Lucky
- Founders and companies create their own luck.
- They do this by:
	- Building get Product
	- Outworking everyone
	- Seeking opportunities
	- Charting the Long-term Vision
- Patience is not a virtue.
- Make things happen and "luck" will follow you.

# Take Notes from Everyone
- Most advice is not usable.
- And much of it comes from people who have never done the thing they tell you.
- Be selective about whom you listen to.
- Be more selective about what you implement.

# Slow and Steady Wins the Race
- Speed is your greatest advantage.
	- The faster you move, the faster you learn
	- The faster you learn, the faster you execute
	- The faster you execute, the faster you win
- Time is your enemy, and you need to defeat it.

# There’s Time to Side Hustle
- Your company needs to be your whole hustle.
	- If you split your time in any way, it will compound against you.
	- If you focus on one thing, your instincts will actually matter.
- Be all in, or all out.
	- It's either a "Hell yes!" or a "No".

# It’s Too Late to Start
- The richest people in history have largely made their money after age 50.
	- And you only get wiser and more efficient over time.
- It was better to start 20 years ago, but the next best time is today.
- Putting it off for tomorrow assures your failure.

# Keep Trying and You’ll Succeed
- Not every project deserves a long runway.
- If your idea is simply not working, be strong enough to kill it.
- You can always generate more ideas.
- You can't generate more time.
- If you're working on a clear dud, pivot

# Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)
- We are taught in school EMH is real but this is far from the truth.
- Where EMH is wrong, you will find great wealth.
- There are opportunities everywhere.
