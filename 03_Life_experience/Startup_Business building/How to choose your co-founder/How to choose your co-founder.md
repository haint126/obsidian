	- Investors will listen to them
	- The team and the press will watch their every word & action
	- They have the rights to the company’s finances, statements, upside, and relationships.

## Verification
- Work with the person for at least a full month
- Build and ship REAL product to REAL customers.

## Legal
- Make sure that any introductory work done with a partner is *documented*.
- If you don’t compensate & document, they could claim that they’re a co-founder and entitled to a major chunk of your company.
- **Pro tip**:
	- Use a self-serve legal tool online to do 90% of the work, and then run it by an attorney for final tweaks.
		- [i.e. eforms.com](eforms.com/employment/independent-contractor/)

## Equity split
- If you have found your perfect co-founder, go 50/50
- There are alternatives:
	- Minority Ownership Cofounder:
		- If you’re driving outsized value, you can bring on a cofounder for 10-15% ownership
	- Founding “ROLE”:
		- You can bring someone on as a Founding CTO, Founding Head of Eng, etc.
		- Equity percentages range from 2%-6%
		- This person isn’t quite cofounder material, but they’re a 10X employee worth giving outsized equity and title to.
- **Pro tip**:
	- If you’re not 100% sure you’re ready for marriage, make sure to retain board control.
		- This means you have more board votes than they do, or that they’re not on the board at all.

## Pitfalls
- Balance between demanding and giving equity
- Command fair title and ownership, but don’t let your ego drive the negotiation.

## Working with friends
- Your most likely cofounder is an existing friend.
- BUT don’t forgo the advice above just because someone’s a friend

## Discovery process
- Build a list
	- Go through every contact on your phone, fb, linkedin, etc. and write down every person you love and respect.
- Start to engage
	- Coffees, meetings, social events (lunches, dinners, etc)
- Choose a date
	- Out of these interactions, pick your favorite and ask them if they’re open to working on a project together
- Repeat
	- Do this until you find “the one”

# Working successfully together
