## Action
- Hire and give your employee the work you are not good at
- Do the thing you are good at
- Think about what customers need
- Aim for profit and time

# Profitability > Growth
- I invested in a company making $500k/month with 5 employees.
- He hired 13 more, and should’ve been making $1M+, right?
- Nope. He went out of business.
- Profit is always the only number.

# Buying > Building
- I built a fashion marketplace for $100K and lost it all.
- I built a logistics business for $50k and only make $100k.
- I invested in 5 startups that made $0.
- I bought 1 business, then 20+ and made 8 figures.
- Buy profits day 1.

# Boring Doesn't Mean Ugly
- We have a laundromat that does $3M.
- We have 12 carwashes that we'll sell for 18x profits.
- We take boring things and:
	- Make them beautiful
	- Make cold customer service friendly
	- Add text, delete fax machines

# Know (And Play To) Your Strengths
- Are you a maker?
	- Create a new product for an existing biz.
- In advertising?
	- Get a business with bad marketing.
- Love being neck-deep in SEO?
	- Make your store top ranking on google.
- Buy your strengths, and outsource your weaknesses.

# Fill In Your Gaps
- Don't hire people because you'd want to get a beer with them.
- Hire them because you would never get joy out of the skills they find it in.
- Skill stack your team.
- No one wins a game of chess with all kings.

# Strategic Narcissism is a Business Killer
- Strategic Narcissism is thinking about what you want to do but not what others need
- This business ran before you.
- It will run after you.
- It can run without you.
- (And if it can’t, that’s a bad thing).

# Delegation Is How You Scale
- Be humble enough to pass off the day-to-day to operators.
- Wouldn’t you rather be working 3-5 hours/week and spending more time re-investing your skills and cash?
- Don’t hire a dog and then try to bark for it.
