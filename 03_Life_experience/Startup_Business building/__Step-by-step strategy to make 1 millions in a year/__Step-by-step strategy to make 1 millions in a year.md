# First, you need to understand the math.
- This isn't about making $1m in revenue/profit.
	- This is about EQUITY üí∞
- Here's how it works:

> $15,000 Monthly Profit
> x 12 Months
> = $180,000 Annual Profit
> x 5-6 exit multiple
> = $1,000,000 Acquisition

- Equity = Leverage üîë

# Next, let's talk about CUSTOMERS
- Customers come first, ideas come after.
- Ideal Customers: PROSUMERS üî•
- Examples:
	- üëâ Shopify Owners
	- üëâ Content Creators
	- üëâ Agency Owners
- They are highly motivated to succeed and willing to INVEST in their success.
- At the CORE, prosumers want 2 things:
	1. To Make More Money
	2. To Get More Attention

- They don't necessarily care about HOW.
	- They will spend money on tools & resources to turn their DREAMS into a REALITY.
- üî• UNDERSTAND THIS.

# Now, let's talk about your idea:
- The priority here is to keep it SIMPLE.
- One Problem üëâ One Solution
	- You don't have to build the next Facebook to make $1,000,000 ‚ùå
- Example:
	- Shopify owners struggle to find influencers to promote their brand.
- Idea: creator discovery tool
	- Your primary goal is to understand the problem a group of people is experiencing & create a TOOL to help them achieve their desired outcome.
	- üìç Point A --> üìç Point B.
- Here's some more tips for finding ideas üëá

# Now you have an idea, let's build your offer.
- Prosumers (generally) have less disposable income which means they are looking for affordable solutions.
- Your goal is to create a service that you can sell for less than $100/month.
	- Our average subscription was ~$60/month
- Prosumers are also less willing to "throw money away" on new things.
	- The easiest way to boost sign-ups is offering a free trial.
	- Offer 7 days for free.
	- üî• REQUIRE CREDIT CARD TO START.
- Fewer trial sign-ups but better conversion rates from trial to paying user

# Now it's time to build:
- You are building a VEHICLE for value delivery.
	- Databases
	- Chrome Extensions
	- Dashboards
	- Automations
	- ... you have options
- Answer 1 question:
	- What's the simplest way to deliver value?
- Here's a VEHICLE I built in 24 hours + $120üëá
	- [Building a micro-business in 24 hours.](https://twitter.com/ImSamThompson/status/1599186169954463744)
- You don't have to be a developer or pay $10,000+ to build a valuable SaaS product.
