# TLDR
- Great questions are
	- Open-ended
		- Invite deeper dialogue
	- Neutral
		- Do not insert assumption or opinion
	- Lean
		- Simple and direct

# 1. Open-ended
- Open questions invite deeper dialogue.
	- They encourage the person to expand.
- Closed questions (yes/no) do the opposite.

## Open-ended examples:
- Examples:
	- What is exciting you right now?
	- Why do people struggle with that?
	- How would you solve this problem?
- These Qs are probing for conversation.
- They can’t be answered with yes/no.

## Closed-ended examples:
- Examples:
	- Did you buy the truck?
	- Is the steak here good?
	- Are you going to the game?
	- Should we go on a hike today?
- These Qs are quick and transactional.
- There will likely be no depth to the response.

# 2. Neutral
- Neutral questions don’t “lead” the person.
	- They allow them to naturally follow their curiosity.
- Non-neutral questions are often called “loaded.”
	- Consciously or subconsciously, they are biased.

## Neutral examples:
- Examples:
	- What inspired that?
	- What happened next?
	- How did you decide that?
	- Why did you do it that way?
	- How would you explain this?
- These questions have no bias.
- They are objective and curious.

## Non-neutral examples:
- Examples:
	- Why do you get defensive so easily?
	- How were you able to show such courage?
	- What made that such a terrible play call?
- These Qs carry an assumption or opinion.
- Positively or negatively, they are “loaded.”

# 3. Lean
- Complex questions are hard to answer.
- Simple questions produce thoughtfulness and insight.
- Make it easy for the person to engage.

## Lean examples:
- Examples:
	- What happened then?
	- What did you do next?
	- How did it go?
	- Why?
- Be simple + direct, then get out of the way.

## Non-lean question:
- Examples:
	- There’s so many awesome people on Twitter. Who are your favorite follows, why and what is one great thing you’ve read from each of them?
- See the problem?
	- You don’t even know where to begin.
