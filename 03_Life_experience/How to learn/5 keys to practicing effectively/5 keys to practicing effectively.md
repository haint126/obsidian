# 1. Practice slowly
- Our brains need time to absorb information.
	- When we learn slowly, we remember information.
	- When we learn quickly, we forget almost immediately.
- If you do nothing else, practice slowly.

# 2. Practice accurately
- Practicing *wrongly* is worse than not practicing at all?
- Practice slowly to ensure each step is correct.
- Accurate repetition breeds mastery.

# 3. Practice purposefully
- Practicing slowly and accurately is a great foundation.
- But to maximize practice, there must be a purpose.
	- What are you practicing?
	- Why are you practicing that?
	- What does getting better look like?
- 2 hours of mindful practice is far better than 8 hours of mindless practice.

# 4. Practice in small increments
- Long periods of practice are ineffective.
	- A tired mind and body is prone to mistakes.
- Perlmanâ€™s approach:
	- 50 minutes of practice
	- 10 minutes of rest
	- Repeat
- Practice in small increments, followed by breaks.

# 5. Practice enough (but not too much)
- Our brains can absorb only so much information.
	- Our bodies can make purposeful, accurate movements only so many times.
	- At some point, practice is counterproductive.
- Two questions that may help to find your limit:
	- When do I become cognitively overloaded?
	- When am I no longer capable of performing precise physical movements?
