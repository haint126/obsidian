# Learning as playing games
- The key to learning anything: Seeing it as a game
- Every skill is game, so there are:
	- Rules
	- Prizes
	- Losers
	- Winners
	- Shortcuts
	- Different levels
- And here's the 3-part framework to win every time:
	1. Immediately start playing
	2. Totally immerse yourself
	3. Iterate & tighten your feedback loops

# Step 1: Immediately start playing
- This is the most important part of learning any new skill—you have to start immediately.
	- No "thinking" about starting.
	- No "preparing" to start.
	- All of that is procrastination.
- You have to start playing—and losing—quickly.
- Here's why:
- You will suck for your first 20 tries of any new game.
	- Your first 20 ads
	- Your first 20 videos
	- Your first 20 threads
	- Your first 20 cold calls
	- Your first 20 workouts
	- Your first 20 photographs
- All of them will suck.
- And that's a good thing—here's why:
- Most people have too fragile of an ego to start something and suck at it.
- But you will learn more in those first 20 reps than you will from any book, Ted Talk, or course.
- You will learn:
	- The rules of the game
	- What winning & losing looks like
- And most importantly:
- In those first 20 reps, you will experience your first win.
- And that is all you need to get hooked.
	- Yes, your first 20 will suck.
	- But one of them will click—and that dopamine rush will keep you wanting to play forever.
- Which takes us into Step 2:
