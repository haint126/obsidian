# The Feynman Technique
- The Feynman Technique is a learning framework that requires you to develop a deep understanding of a given topic.
- It involves four key steps:
	- Set the Stage
	- ELI5 (Explain It To Me Like I'm 5)
	- Assess & Study
	- Organize, Convey & Review

## Step 1: Set the Stage
- What’s the topic you want to learn?
- Starting with a blank page, write the topic at the top and jot down everything you know about it.
- Read & research the topic.
- Add any new learnings or insights as you develop them.

## Step 2: ELI5
- Here's where it gets unique:
- Attempt to explain the topic to someone without a base understanding of it (i.e. a “child”).
- On a blank page, write down everything you know about your topic—but pretend you are explaining it to a child.
- Use simple language!

## Step 3: Assess & Study
- Reflect on your performance—form an honest assessment.
- How well were you able to explain the topic to a child? Where did you get frustrated? Where did you turn to jargon?
- These are the gaps in your understanding!
- Read and study more to fill them.

## Step 4: Organize, Convey & Review
- Organize your elegant, simple language into a clear, compelling story or narrative.
- Convey it to a few others, then iterate and refine accordingly.
- Review your new, deep understanding of the topic.
- Remember: Simple is beautiful.
