# What your brain is doing

- Your brain craves **novelty** (new, unusual, interesting things).
- Your brain does not record routine, ordinary, normal things.


# Head First learning principles: How to turn your brain on
- **The trick is to get your brain to see the new material you’re learning as Really Important**
	- The slow way is about sheer repetition
	- The faster way is to do anything that increases brain activity, especially different types of brain activity
		- **Make it visual**
			- Images are far more memorable than words
			- Put words within or near the graphics, not on the bottom or on another page
		- **Use a conversation and a personalized style**
			- Tell story instead of lecturing
			- Use casual language
			- Don't take yourself too seriously
		- **Get the learner to think more deeply**
			- A reader has to be motivated, engaged, curious, and inspired to solve problems, draw conclusions, and generate new knowledge.
			- => You need challenges, exercises, and thought-provoking questions, and activities that involve both sides of the brain and multiple senses
		- **Get and keep the reader attention**
			- Your brain pays attention to things that are out of the ordinary, interesting, strange, eye-catching, unexpected
		- **Touch their emotions**
			- Your ability to remember something is largely dependent on its emotional content:
				- Emotions like surprise, curiosity, fun, "what the…?"" , and the feeling of "I rule!"


# What Head first does:

- We used **pictures** then embedded the text in the pictures
- We used **redundancy**, saying the same thing in different ways and with different media types, and multiple senses
- We used concepts and pictures in **unexpected** ways
- We used pictures and ideas with at least some **emotional** content
	- Even if that feeling is nothing more than a little **humor**, **surprise**, or **interest**
- We used a **personalized**, **conversational** style
- We included more than 80 **activities**
	- Because your brain is tuned to learn and remember more when you **do** things than when you *read* about things
- We used **multiple learning styles**
	- Each person has their own preference, but *everyone* benefits from seeing the same content represented in multiple ways.
- We include content for **both sides of your brain**
	- Working one side of the brain often means giving the other side a chance to rest
 - We included **stories** and exercises that present **more than one point of view**
 - We included **challenges** on the *right* things, with exercises, and by asking **questions** that don’t always have a straight answer
 - We used **people** in stories, examples, pictures, and so on.
	 - Because your brain pays more attention to *people* than it does to *things*.


# What you can do

- **Slow down**. The more you **understand**, the less you have to *memorize*
- Do the **exercises**. Write your own **notes**
- Read the "There are No Dumb Questions"
- Make this the **last thing** you read before *bed*. Or at least the last challenging thing
	- Part of the learning (especially the transfer to long-term memory) happens after you put the book down
- **Drink water**. Lots of it
- **Talk** about it. Out loud
	- Better still, try to **explain** it out loud to someone else
- **Listen to your brain**
	- If you find yourself starting to **skim** the surface or **forget** what you just read, it’s time for a *break*
- **Feel** something!
	- **React** to the content even a little is better than feeling *nothing* at all.
- **Create** something!
	- **Apply** this to your daily work
	- Do something to get some experience beyond this book
