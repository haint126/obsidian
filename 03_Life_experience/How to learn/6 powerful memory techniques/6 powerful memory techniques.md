# Some underlie general principles
- Some general principles that underlie the techniques and aid memory:
	1. We don't remember all types of information equally (visual and spatial are best)
	2. Attach new memories to old memories
	3. Make information vivid and exciting
	4. Engage as many senses as possible

# Memory Palace
1. Prepare an organized location (E.g. your house layout)
2. Create markers in this location in an easy to follow order
3. Make a clear image of the information you would like to remember
4. Place each item you are trying to remember on the marked locations

# The Peg Method
- The pegs act much the same way as clothes pegs.
- They keep information hanging around in your mind.
	1. Choose a list of ordered items that you can easily remember (e.g., numbers or months)
	2. When learning new information, attach it to each item in the list

# The Major System
- The system works by converting numbers into consonants, then into words by adding vowels.
- Since remembering words is easier than numbers, this system is used to remember numerical sequences, like telephone numbers or year dates.

# Story Method
- The mind has a natural ability to remember stories.
- Create a vivid story with the key ideas to be remembered.
- Each idea is represented by key words in the story (which link to the next key word and so on).
- Retell the story a few times to engrave it in memory.

# Person-Action-Object (PAO)
- 2-digit numbers from 00 to 99 are represented by an image of a person performing an action on an object.
- The number 34 might be Lebron James (person) dunking (action) into a hoop (object).
- Then combine images to remember long strings of numbers.

# SEE Principle
- Turn images (graphs, drawings, etc.) into exciting things in your mind.
- Sense: When you utilise more senses, you will remember more.
- Exaggerate: Make your images larger or smaller than life. Make your images illogical.
- Energize: Give images action.
