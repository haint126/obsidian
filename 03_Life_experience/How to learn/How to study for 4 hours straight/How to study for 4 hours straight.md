# Why study for 4 hours straight (with little-to-no breaks).
- While 4 hours is the upper bound of our cognitive limit, it IS possible.
- First, why study in a 4-hour block?
- The answer is simple: Batching.
- Two benefits:

	1. You only have to mentally prepare once to study
	2. It eliminates the switching cost of attention between activities.

# 1. Study Your Interests
- Very obvious, very overlooked.
- Learning is infinitely easier when you’re curious about the topic.
- The harsh truth:
	- If you’re not passionate about the topic, you’re going to get beat by people who are.
	- They won’t be counting the hours.

# 2. Have a Plan
- The night before, figure out what you’ll study.
	- Identify a goal for the 4-hour block.
		- “Read chapters x, watch videos y, etc.”
	- Prepare all the resources you need and set them up in advance.
- You’ll have everything you need to start.

# 3. Hide Your Phone
- The best productivity app on your phone is Airplane Mode.
- Would you rather:
	- Be in the library all day unfocused
	- OR
	- Study 4 laser-focused hours and get on with your day?

# 4. Optimize Your Senses
- Activate your 5 senses:
	- 👂: Noise-cancelling headphones
	- 👁️: Hide bad triggers (phone)
	- 👃: Consider an aromatherapy diffuser (peppermint & lemon promote concentration)
	- 👋: Set a cool room temperature for alertness
	- 👅: See tip #5

# 5. Manage Your Energy
- Lack of nutrition destroys willpower, mood, and clear thinking.
- Stock:
	- Water
	- Healthy snacks
	- Caffeine as needed
	- Gum (for concentration).

# 6. Plan for Contingencies
- Coffee shops & libraries can be great motivators
- Plan for contingencies.
- If you find yourself without a charger, a bathroom, or internet...
- You did not plan your mission properly.

# 7. Create Incentives
- Plan a fun reward for after your studying.
	- A favorite show? A date or meal with a friend?
- You’ll be more motivated to focus now,
	- So you can enjoy your time later.
