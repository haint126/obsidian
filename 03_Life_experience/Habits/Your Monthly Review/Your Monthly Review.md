# 0. Why
- The beauty of this process is you can constantly capture these things throughout the month.
	- Wins & milestones
	- Realizations & decisions
	- Things going well & things to improve
- Then, at the end of the year, you collect these monthly reviews and distill the entire year!
- Here is how you create your monthly review

# 1. What were my biggest wins & milestones?
- These are things that you will look back on with pride & fond memories at the end of the year.
	- Health wins
	- Business wins
	- New relationships
	- Goals accomplished
	- Fun memories & events
- Here's why you start with this one:
	- Recapping wins & milestones kicks the review off on a positive note.
	- And it also creates a "ledger" of wins from the year.

# 2. What were my biggest realizations?
- By constantly collecting these realizations, you are always learning.
- Most of my realizations are about my:
	- Health
	- Beliefs
	- Business
	- Lack of skills
	- Relationships
- By constantly iterating and distilling these lessons, you will level up month after month after month.

# 3. What areas am I most satisfied? Least satisfied?
- Split the page in 2 columns and brain dump bullet points of everything that comes to mind.
- The goal here is to identify in the present moment what's working and what's not working.

# 4. Based on these areas, what am I going to do more of? Less of?
- This is the 80/20 rule in action.
- 20% of your:
	- Habits
	- Beliefs
	- Friends
	- Actions
- Are leading to 80% of both your positive *and* negative results.
- Now you should have 2 lists:
	- Things to *double down* on that are bringing you the positive results
	- Things to *stop doing entirely* that are bringing you the negative results
- Put those lists somewhere you can see them every morning (for me, that's on my bathroom mirror).

# 5. What am I thinking about for the month ahead?
- This is a quick list of things you're:
	- Excited about
	- Thinking about
	- Uncertain about
- This turns into a letter to your future self you can read at the end of the month.
