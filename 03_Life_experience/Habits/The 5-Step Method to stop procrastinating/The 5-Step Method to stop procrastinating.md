# TLDR
- The 5-Step Method:
	1. Awareness
	2. Deconstruction
	3. Plan Creation
	4. Stake (Mental force) Creation
	5. Action
		- Use quick win

# Awareness
- As with most mental hurdles, the first step is becoming aware of the problem.
- Procrastination is defined as the action of postponing or delaying something.
- I categorize procrastination-prone tasks into two types:
	- Type I: Big & Scary
	- Type II: Small & Boring
- Type I is the most damning.
	- These are the long-term important projects - the growth creators.

## Action
- Schedule a daily assessment of your day-to-day actions.
- Ask a few questions:
	- Am I proud of the actions I am taking on these big projects?
	- Am I doing what I should be doing?
- If you answer “no” - great! You're aware of your procrastination and can proceed to the next step...

# Deconstruction
- The driver of Type I procrastination is that big & scary projects are...well...big & scary.
- In his famous Ted Talk, [@waitbutwhy](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy) uses the example of a senior thesis.
	- If you define the project as "write my 100-page thesis" you are pre-wired for procrastination.
- It's critical to deconstruct the big and scary project into small and incremental tasks.

## Action
- In the example of the senior thesis, the tasks might be:
	- Gather important research
	- Annotate key pieces
	- Craft thesis outline
	- Etc.
- The Goal: Convert intimidating into manageable.

# Plan Creation
- Now you need a plan of attack.
- The plan should be:
	- Specific - exactly what you'll do
	- Time Bound - when you'll do it
- Important: We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day - lean towards less ambitious time bounds to give yourself easy wins early.

## Action
- I find it helpful to create a project document.
	- Write down the specific tasks under each major deconstructed pillar of the project.
	- Write down your timeline for starting and completing each.
- Once complete, hide the future pillars to avoid intimidation.
- Focus on the present.

# Stake Creation
- This is perhaps the most important - and most overlooked - step of the framework.
- You can create - and raise - stakes as a means to driving better outcomes.
- Mental games can be very effective.

## Action
- A few ideas:
	- Public declaration
	- Social pressure
	- Reward or penalty
- Public Declaration: State your intentions publicly. It makes it harder to flake!
- Social Pressure: Plan to meet a friend somewhere to do the initial work.
- Reward or Penalty: Plan a reward or penalty if you do/don't do what you're supposed to.

# Action
- Action is the hardest part - specifically the first action, the first motion.
- But remember: a body in motion tends to stay in motion.

## Action
- To get started, you can try the following:
	- Plan a "sync session” - meet a friend for that initial movement (h/t [@Julian](https://twitter.com/Julian)).
	- Reward movement - attach a small reward to completing initial movement (e.g. a walk).
	- Lion technique - commit to a short sprint followed by rest.
- Give yourself a quick win
	- Winning is contagious.
	- Small wins become big wins.
- Make sure to work in line with your energy.
	- Schedule focused sprints during times of day when your creative energy is abundant.
- The entire framework is intended to be dynamic and iterative.
	- Constantly assess and tweak your plan and process. Find new ways to raise the stakes and get moving.
- It's not perfect, but this framework will help you bust through the walls of procrastination.
