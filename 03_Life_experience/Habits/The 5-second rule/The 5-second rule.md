# The 5 Second Rule by Mel Robbins.
- Remember that moment as kids? Counting down 5, 4, 3, 2, 1…before jumping into a pool?

	- Or to step on stage for a career-changing keynote,
- The 5 Second Rule will get you where you need to be.

# How the 5 Second Rule Works
- "The moment you have an instinct to act on a goal you must 5-4-3-2-1 and physically move or your brain will stop you." —Mel Robbins.
- The 5s Rule improves your 'locus of control.'
	- It helps you flip the switch from uncontrolled anxiety to excitement.
- According to neuroscientists, 95% of our decisions are based on feelings.
	- You must FIRST change how you feel to change your behavior
	- In the words of Aristotle, "Do good, feel good."
- Exactly what the 5 Second Rule will help you DO.

- The kicker:

	- Once we're immersed in sun-shimmered water,

	- Enjoying the freedom of weightlessness,

	- We wish we'd jumped in sooner.

	- It's as simple as 5, 4, 3, 2, 1…
