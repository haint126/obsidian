# The 4-7-8 breathing method
- The breathing technique was discovered by Dr. Andrew Weil
	- Based on the ancient yoga practice of pranayama
- It is used to **reduce stress**

## How to do 4-7-8 breathing
1. Breathe in through your nose for a 4-second count.
2. Hold your breath for a 7-second count.
3. Exhale for an 8-second count, making a "whoosh" sound through pursed lips.
4. Repeat up to four times, twice per day.

## Why it works
- It activates the parasympathetic nervous system
	- Which is responsible for our rest and digest mode,
- It switches off the sympathetic nervous system
	- Which triggers our stress response (or fight or flight mode)
