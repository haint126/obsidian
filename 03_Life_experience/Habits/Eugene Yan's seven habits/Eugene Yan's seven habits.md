# Reading
Books are pre-trained models for the mind

• Read a few books at a time (heavy, med, light) so you always have a book no matter your mood or energy level
• Recognize that there are tree books and branch books; branch books can be skimmed


# Gratitude
Getting off the hedonic treadmill

• At the start of each day, think of 3 things you're grateful for; write them down
• When something bad happens, be glad it didn't turn out worse
• Consider negative visualization

# Meditation
Calm your mind's monkeys & panic monsters
• Start each day with 5 - 10 minutes of mindful meditation
• Throughout the day, meditate & focus on your breath to calm your mind

# Energy management
Quality of energy > Quantity of time

• Schedule your day around your energy levels
• Block time for deep work when your energy is highest
• Schedule 50 min meetings instead of an hour; 25 min instead of 30 min—this gives time to stretch & bathroom breaks

# Exercise
Feel better, sleep better, get more energy, and oh, look better


• Starting out: 7-minute workout apps are pretty good
• Building muscle: StrongLift 5x5 & Julian's guide are easy to follow
• Don't neglect cardio: Have 1 - 2 sessions each week
