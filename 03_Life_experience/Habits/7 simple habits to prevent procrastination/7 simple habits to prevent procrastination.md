# 1. Plan Your Tomorrow Today
- Take 10-15 minutes at the end of each day to plan 2-3 most important tasks for tomorrow.
- The next morning, you'll know what to work on without thinking.

# 2. Remove Distractions
- Turn off all notifications on your phone and computer.
- Block all social media websites on your browser with Block & Focus chrome extension.
- Use noise-canceling earbuds.
- Don't have food near to you.
- Get rid of any other potential distractions.

# 3. Break Your Days Into Mini-Days
- I use 3 "mini-days" that are 3 hours long each.
	1. 6am-9am
	2. 9am-12pm
	3. 12pm - 3pm

# 4. Work In 25-Minute Sprints
- Use [Pomodoro](https://pomofocus.io/) to execute your tasks.
- Every hour of my mini-day has 2 Pomodoro sessions:
	- 25 minutes - Work on one task
	- 5 minutes - quick break
	- 25 minutes - Work on one task
	- 5 minutes - quick break
	- = total of 60 minutes.

# 5. No Multitasking
- Focus on ONE task for each 25-minute sprint.
- Break it into actionable steps.
- And don't do anything else.

# 6. Make Not-To-Do List
- Write down all the things that waste your time and energy.
	- Watching YouTube videos
	- Checking phone in the morning
	- Consistently checking email
	- Eating at a desk
- Use it to remind yourself of what you are committed to not doing during the day.

# 7. Get Quality Sleep
- Lack of sleep will ruin your productivity.
	- Use blue light blocking glasses 2h before bed
	- No food & caffeine 2h before bed
	- Lower the temperature in your bedroom
	- Stick to consistent sleep schedule
	- Buy Oura ring to track your sleep
