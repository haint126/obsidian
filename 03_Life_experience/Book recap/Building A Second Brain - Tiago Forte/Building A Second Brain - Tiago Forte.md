# Recap
- Your professional success and quality of life depend directly on your ability to manage information effectively.
- Before we do anything with our ideas, we have to 'off-load' them from our minds and put them into concrete form. Only when we declutter our brain of complex ideas can we think clearly and start to work with those ideas effectively.
- Once our thoughts are outside our head, we can examine them, play with them, and make them better. It's like a shortcut to realizing the full potential of the thoughts driving through our minds.
- Information becomes knowledge–personal, embodied, verified–only when we put it to use. You gain confidence in what you know only when you know that it works.
- Every time you take a note, ask yourself, 'How can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?' That question will lead you to annotate the words and phrases that explain why you saved a note, what you were thinking, and what exactly caught your attention.
