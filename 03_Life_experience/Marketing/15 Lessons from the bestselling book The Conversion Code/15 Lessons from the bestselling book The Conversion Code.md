1. "It's one thing to get someone to 'like,' 'follow,' or subscribe by emailâ€“it's another to get their time and it's a whole other thing to earn someone's business."

	- More than 50% of people have bought a product after seeing a YouTuber review it
4. "Reels get exponentially more views than a regular post with a video...I've tested how many video views I get with a reel versus a non-reel many times and the reel always gets 10x more views."
