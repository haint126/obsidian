# “Better” is a great differentiator
- If you can make your offer better than the competition’s, winning will be a lot easier.
- Home Depot’s primary advantage was simply providing a better customer experience than most other brands in the space.

# “Different” is also a great differentiator
- Sometimes better isn’t possible, and even if it is, be a bit different too.
- Netflix didn’t try to beat Blockbuster with video stores.
- Instead, they offered something different: DVDs in the mail to start, then streaming.

# “More personal” is a good one too.
- Another way to carve out a piece of the market is by showing more personality.
- Compare Chipotle’s bags to Taco Bell’s bags and you’ll see the power of personality.

# "Flexibility" is a competitive advantage.
- Established brands tend to move slowly.
- Small brands can move faster, iterate faster, and take more risks.
- If you’re just starting out, understand and utilize this advantage.

# "Persistence" pays.
- The running theme through all these stories is that the underdog didn’t shy away from competing and didn’t back down when beaten up a bit.
- Things rarely go smoothly in life.
- Persistence is essential, not optional.
