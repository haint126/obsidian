# 1. Upsell existing customers:
- Most customers are happy to spend 20-30% more than their average purchase if you nudge them along.
- Send automated emails that move them up the ladder.
- Showcase premium offerings, bundles, rewards programs, subscriptions, etc.

# 2. Cross-sell existing customers:
- Get customers to buy something they never had before.
- Look at your product data. There are likely 2 or 3 product combos that go well together.
- Send an automated cross-sell email if someone buys one product and not the other.

# 3. Winback old customers:
- Your customer hasn't bought in a long time. That's okay.
- Winning this customer back is easier and cheaper than acquiring a new one.
- Identify the key dropoff point (e.g. has not purchased in 90 days) and set up automated emails around that time.

# 4. Convert window shoppers:
- A potential customer comes to your site, pokes around, looks at some products, and leaves.
- Send at least 3 follow-up emails showcasing value props, social proof, and potentially a discount.
- This is a high intent customer you want to convert.

# 5. Convert abandoned carts:
- These customers need one more push to get them over the finish line.
- Again, you can do this with email automation.
	- Answer FAQs
	- Offer a discount
	- Promote urgency
- Show the products they abandoned

# 6. Increase Lifetime Value (LTV):
- The best way to stay in contact with your customer between purchases is by email.
- Don't wait and hope for them to come back organically.
- Proactively reach out and influence purchase behavior with auto emails that fit your customer lifecycle.

# 7. Retain customers:
- When a customer leaves your site, competitors try to steal their attention.
- Use email to stay top of mind.
- Provide consistent value and retain their loyalty with ongoing education.

# 8. Onboard new customers:
- The customer experience is just beginning after checkout.
- Hand-hold your customer and show them how to get the most out of your product/service.
- Remind them why they made the right choice with a series of emails.

# 9. Collect leads to follow up with:
- Over 95% of your site traffic will not purchase.
- If you don't collect emails, they might never come back.
- Have an email form ready on your highest-traffic pages. Email marketing keeps the conversation going.

# 10. Lower Customer Acquisition Cost:
- You are spending a lot of money on paid ads to get traffic to your site.
- The cost of using email marketing is minimal.
- Any conversion from email marketing helps take pressure off your paid spend.

# 11. Collect customer feedback:
- Send out automated email surveys to:
	- Track your NPS score
	- Collect qualitative feedback
	- Set up 1-on-1 customer interviews
- Crave customer feedback.
- There will always be answers that surprise you.
