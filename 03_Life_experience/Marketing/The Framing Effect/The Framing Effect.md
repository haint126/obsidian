# The Framing Effect
- *How* you say something often matters more than *what* you say

## How to apply
- Alright, so how can you apply this to sell more?
	1. Emphasize pain points In plain language. Avoid jargon.
	2. Reframe to focus on the positive
	3. Benefits before features, always
- And always remember: we pay more attention when the information we care about is highlighted

# Types of the Framing Effect

## 1. Effective Framing

### Fuel economy
- The average person doesn’t know that 22 MPG is industry-leading fuel economy
- That message is lost on them
- But “Best in class for Fuel economy” means something
- Same information, different Framing

### New phone's battery life
- You need a new phone
	- Phone A claims “20-hour battery life”
	- Phone B claims “All-day battery life”
- Which one do you choose?
	- You likely choose B and there’s a reason
- “20-hour battery life” simply states the facts
- But “All-day battery life” frames long-battery life as the solution to your pain point

## 2. Value Framing
- A 10% discount on a $10 price is more tempting than a $1 discount
- However, the opposite can also be true
- A $100 discount on a $1000 item sounds better than a 10% discount
- The value of the discount depends on how you frame it

## 3.Positive & Negative Framing

### Fat amount
- Technically, both yogurt below have the same amount of fat
- But which one is more appealing?
- Since fat is typically seen as a bad thing—although new research shows it's not—framing the yogurt as “80% fat-free!” turns it into something positive

### Toothpaste
- Knowing that 9 out of 10 dentists recommend a specific toothpaste instills confidence
- But saying, “Only 10% of dentists don’t recommend Sensodyne” doesn’t quite have the same ring to it, right? 😅

### Medicine
- Positive framing is often used in medicine too
- Imagine you have a serious illness and need a complex procedure
- It’s not the same if your doctor says you have a “5% chance of dying” than a “95% chance of survival”
- Studies show using the right frame can save lives

## 4. Visual framing

### Font size
- One example of visual framing is font size
- Example: If we see $25 in large font, our brain notices how BIG the font is and assumes the price is big
- But if you display the same price with smaller font, buyers can perceive it as cheaper
