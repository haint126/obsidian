# 1. Curiosity Gap
- If you want people to read your content, you need to make them curious.
- Lesson: begin with the desired emotion you want to evoke in your reader before you write a headline.
- 7 powerful emotions to keep in mind:
	- LOL
	- WTF
	- WOW
	- NSFW, crazy
	- Ohhh, now I get it
	- Finally, someone said it
	- Yay!

# 2. The IKEA Effect
- We tend to value something more if we feel a sense of ownership over it.
- Whether we’ve made an effort to build or assemble it, we put additional value to it.
- Your customers attribute a higher value to things they feel like they own.
- Lesson: Help increase your user's ownership of your product.
- Some ideas:
	- Make them tinker with the product from the get-go
	- Adjust features to their needs
	- Invest in sharing their information
	- Encouraging feedback
	- Involve them (chats, office hours, podcast, blog)

# 3. Reciprocity Principle
- We feel obligated to return favors after people do favors for us.
- Ever wondered why restaurants give you mints after your meal?
- Well, on average one mint results in a 3% higher tip, and if they add 2 mints, it goes up by 14%.

- If a brand offers you free valuable content or resources frequently, you're more likely to engage, recommend, or become their customer.
- Lesson: Give something of value for free today, and you’ll reap the rewards later.

# 4. Anchoring Bias
- We rely too heavily on the first piece of information (“anchor”) we are given about a topic.
- It distorts our perception.
- Numbers presented to us are powerful. Our brain latches on to them, even when we know we are irrelevant – like thinking about your social security number.
- Lesson: apply anchoring by making the 1st price or number shown so high that other prices seem like a discount.

# 5. Social Proof
- We tend to copy those around us when we don't know what the "right" behavior or choice is.
- We are looking for clues of trust, quality, and reputation in others.
- Lesson: use the experience of others to help people see the benefits of your product.

# 6. Loss aversion
- Studies show that the pain of a loss is 2x as strong as the reward felt from a gain.
- Discover your customer’s challenges, worries, and remove their fears up front.
- Lesson:
	- To deal with loss aversion, try: risk-free trials and money-back guarantees to deal with loss aversion.
	- To introduce loss aversion, try: countdown timers to remind you that the offer will expire soon.

# 7. Decoy Effect
- Adding a 3rd less attractive option can influence our perception of the two previous choices.
- Lesson: put the decoy effect into action in your pricing strategy. Add an option that seems faulty or that doesn’t quite add up. It'll make the other 2 more appealing.

# 8. Mere Exposure Effect
- We tend to like things or people that we see often.
- Repeated exposure increases familiarity.
- Lesson: repurpose your content so that you show up often and stay top of mind.

# 9. Social Currency
- We share stuff that makes us look cool, smart, and in the know.
- Lesson: identify what's remarkable about your brand and make people feel like insiders.
