# How to find out which advice you should follow
- When you’re reading advice from people on social media, ask yourself:
	- Does this person actually do what they say?
	- Does this person operate in a way that aligns with my values?
	- Can this person prove, without a doubt, that they are having success?
- If you cannot answer a resounding, “Hell Yes!” to each of these, then consider taking advice from someone else.
- And even if the answer is yes to all three, remember that everyone’s experience is different.


# 3 big advice lies
- In a world of armchair quarterbacks, the same bad advice gets regurgitated repeatedly.


## You Should Find a Mentor → You Should Attract a Mentor
- You cannot just hope to go and successfully find a good mentor right off the bat

- The people who end up with great mentors make themselves attractive to other successful people:
	- Share their thoughts and learnings openly
	- Participate in discussions
	- Make meaningful progress
	- Invest in relationships with other people who are doing the same.

- **Action**:
	- Join a few communities on Discord or Slack or other social media platform and start sharing everything you’re learning in real-time.
	- Find the people who want to spend time with you and grow together.

## Help Everyone → Invest in Reciprocal Relationships

- There are 2 types of people in this world:
	- Group A: Those who only receive and never return it.
	- Group B: Those who receive and return the favor when relevant.

- That may sound highly transactional, but most relationships ARE transactional in the very beginning.
- Reciprocity is simply the way to show commitment to a relationship
- Reciprocity can come in many forms: love, support, knowledge, mental help, physical help, etc.

- **Action**:
	- Do an audit of your ecosystem and figure out who is invested in you and who is taking advantage of your generosity
	- Spend more time with the former
	- Start to eliminate the latter.


## Take Big Risks to Make it Big → Take a Lot of Small Risks
- Instead of looking at Musk, Bezos, and Jobs, ask yourself this question instead:
	- “How many people have tried to do what these three did, and failed?”
- If 3 out of a million make it, it’s probably not the right choice for you.

- Failure makes you stronger, as long as it costs almost nothing.
- If you sacrifice 3yrs of your life chasing a big bet that never materializes, failure won’t make you stronger. It will crush you. It will demoralize you.
- Think small, and stay in the game.

- **Action**:
	- Look for the lowest hanging fruit - how can you make $1?
	- Try many different things at once - lay out all of your options.
	- Find the 20% of your effort that leads to 80% of the results - Double down on those.
