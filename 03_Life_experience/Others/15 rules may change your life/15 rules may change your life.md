# 1. Reread your favorite books.
- You may read thousands of books in your life, but there will only be a few that deeply change the way you think.
- Reread them every single year.
	- Your experience with the book will change as you do - you'll pick up new ideas.

# 2. Never take advice from people on the sidelines.
- When you're in the arena, never take advice from the people on the sidelines.
- It's easy to stand on the sidelines.
- It's hard to stand in the arena.

# 3. Always pursue the path that has the larger luck surface area.
- Your daily actions can put you in a position where luck is more likely to strike.
	- It’s hard to get lucky watching TV at home
	- It’s easy to get lucky when you’re out engaging and learning.
- Open yourself to luck.

# 4. When you think something nice about someone, let them know.
- The next time you have a positive thought about someone - tell them right then.


# 5. Stop and savor the beautiful moments of life.
- When you encounter a moment of pure bliss, pause and embrace every aspect of it.
	- The smells, the sounds, the feelings, the sensations.

# 6. Radically reduce your news consumption.
- Want to know more about the world? Turn off the news.
	- News are biased perspectives and will clouds your understanding

# 7. Move your body every single day.
- Daily activity is essential to your health, brain function, and happiness.
- Keep it simple:
	- Walk for 30 min
	- Raise your HR for 30 min
	- Mobility work for 5 min

# 8. If you want to improve at anything, do it every day for 30 straight days.
- My 30-for-30 approach:
	- 30 days
	- 30 min per day
- 30 days is a real commitment, but small enough to mentally take it on.
- 900 minutes of accumulated effort yields surprisingly significant results.

# 9. Default to generosity.
- If you have the good fortune to be wealthy and successful in life, always be sure to share it with others.
	- Support your family and friends when you're able.

# 10. Make decisions that your 80-year-old self and 10-year-old self would be proud of.
- Your 80-year-old self cares about the long-term compounding of the decisions of today.
- Your 10-year-old self reminds you to stay foolish and have some fun along the way.

# 11. Have faith in the dots.
- You take daily actions with complete uncertainty.
- Faith in the dots allows you to persevere and endure the uncertainty.

# 12. Always take accountability.
- Instead of wasting energy on every obstacle in your way, focus on what you can control and how you can break through.
- Stop looking out. Look in.
- Be accountable. Own your shit.

# 13. Be interested in everyone you encounter.
- Every conversation with a stranger is a chance to learn something new.
- Stop trying to be INTERESTING and focus on being INTERESTED.
- Be present in every conversation with everyone you meet.
- You never know what you might learn.

# 14. Use money to simplify, not complicate.

# 15. Always prioritize people.
- Everything in life comes down to people and relationships.
- Networks compound as well as any financial investment.
- Build an army that is deep and wide.
- Cultivate deep relationships, but also learn to appreciate the power of weak ties.

# 16. Spend more time doing things you never regret.
- A few things I never regret:
	- Time with my wife and son
	- Creative sprints
	- Talking to smart friends
	- Journaling for 5 min
	- Going for a walk
	- Sleeping 8 hours
- Make your list—then spend more time on it!

# 17. If you want something (and have put in the work to deserve it), ask for it.
- A little push goes a long way. Don't sit back and wait for good things to happen.
	- Worst case: you’re told no and nothing has changed.
	- Best case: it’s yours.
- Closed mouths don’t get fed.


# 18. Plan as you go
