# Top 20 lifting mistakes to avoid
1. Flaring your elbows out when bench pressing

	- You want your elbows to be a slight angle to work the chest & avoid shoulder injuries.

2. Using a bosu ball

	- All they do is provide instability & decrease force. You'll get better results from lifting on a solid surface.

3. Not using a spotter for your heaviest lifts

	- You're able to lift heavier & avoid injury when you have a spotter to assist you. Take advantage of this.

4. Excessive spotting

	- If your spotter has to use too much force to help you lift a weight you're doing too much.

5. Doing too many sit-ups & crunches

	- These don't work your core effectively & put your lower back in flexion over multiple reps. Avoid.

6. Copying steroid users

	- Steroid users can recover faster & do more in the gym. A natural should never copy a steroid users workout.

7. Combo exercises (Ex. a squat to shoulder press)

	- Strength differs between movements. They look good for IG but are horrible to build muscle.

8. Doing burpees

	- Doing excessive burpees puts undo pressure on your back, wrists & knees. Doing these to fatigue just makes it worse.

9. Sucking in your stomach for your core.

	- To use your core effectively you must brace them by pushing them out. Sucking them in makes you weak.

10. Not re-racking your weights.

	- This is like not putting your shopping cart back. Respect the gym by re-racking your weights.

11. Using your workouts to burn fat

	- Use your workouts to build muscle because this will help you burn more fat.

12. Not eating enough protein to support muscle building

	- You need to eat to support your goals. Aim for .8 to 1g per lbs of bodyweight to support muscle building.

13. Ego lifting

	- Don't lift big weights with horrible form to impress people you don't even know.

14. Lifting right in front of the dumbbell rack.

	- You're stopping people from grabbing the dumbbells by standing there like a goofball. Step away.

15. Not recovering enough

	- You don't build muscle in the gym. You break it down. It is in rest where you build muscle. Prioritize recovery.

16. Not sleeping enough

	- A good nights sleep helps you recover faster. Focus on getting both the quantity & quality you need.

17. Not using progressive overload

	- Progressive overload is gradually increasing the weight, volume or frequency in your routine. This challenges your body to build muscle.
18. Not tracking your workouts

	- What gets measured gets managed. Track your workouts to make progress.

19. Using your workouts as an excuse to eat like shit

	- Your workouts don't burn as many calories as you think. Stop thinking an hour in the gym will cancel out a cheeseburger.

20. Not working out legs

	- Legs are 50% of the human body & are your foundation. Don't neglect them.
