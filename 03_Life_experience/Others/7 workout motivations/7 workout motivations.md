# TLDR

- Use Temptation Bundling
- Set a SMART Goal and Track It
- Ditch the 'All or Nothing' Mentality

# 1. Know Your Why
- There's no wrong 'Why' for health, except not having one.
- Ideas:
	- Improve dating options
	- Look younger, longevity
	- Confidence from a killer bod
	- Energy to play with your kids on the front lawn
- Choose what you need, then dominate.

# 2. Work Out in the Morning
- You intend to hit the gym after work,
	- 99% of us will never make it.
	- Don't be another statistic.
- Go to sleep early, work out early, and soonâ€¦
	- You'll be unrecognizable.
	- Imagine stepping out of the gym.
		- You've just CRUSHED a workout.
		- The rest of the world is still sleeping.
		- There is no better feeling.

# 3. Make Logistics Easy
- The closer to your workout space,
	- The less early you'll have to wake up
	- The more likely you'll be to go.
- It's one reason home gyms are a great investment (if you can).
	- A suspension trainer like TRX works wonders in compact spaces.

# 4. Use Temptation Bundling
- Pick something you love (podcast, magazine, show, etc.).
	- Then, only enjoy it while you're working out.
- For example, Arianna Huffington loves the show Bridgerton.
	- But she only allows herself to watch it on a treadmill.

# 5. Work Out with a Friend
- A workout partner is powerful for accountability.
- Also, try group classes (as tribal creatures, we thrive in joined movement).
	- Pay in advance for group classes.
- Consistency Bias says, you'll be more likely to attend.

# 6. Set a SMART Goal and Track It
- Ex: "I want to lose 14 pounds in 7 weeks by Feb. 19th"
	- Specific: Lose lb
	- Measurable: 14 lb
	- Achievable: 1-2 lb/wk
	- Realistic: Y
	- Timely: Feb. 19th
- What gets measured gets managed.
- Set a goal and track progress with a scale.

# 7. Ditch the "All or Nothing" Mentality
- Your life will never be perfect, but it can be extraordinary.
- You will miss a day in the gym. That is OK.
- What's not OK? Letting that day turn into 3 weeks.
- Use the mantra "Never miss twice" (Hat tip to James Clear).
