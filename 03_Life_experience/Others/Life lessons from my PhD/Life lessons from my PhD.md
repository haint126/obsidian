# Lead or be led
- Use it to keep focused on getting what you want out of something
- Be strategic about your time
- Be ready to tell your interviewers what you want to do instead of letting them tell you what to do


# Topic sentences
- How to write something:
	- Make an outline
	- Write the topic sentence of every paragraph
	- Refine these topic sentences (better iterate on these a few times):
		- Do those sentences convey what you wanted?
		- Do they flow together?
		- Are you missing any major details?
	- Bold these sentences


# Get excited
- Find yourself some happy moments when doing the unexcited parts of your job (or other activities)


# Unmotivated details
- Tell the story that others want to hear not the story that you want to tell


# Slides versus speaker (Tips about presentation)

- There are two main modes of presenting:
	- The speaker leads and the slides assist (slide should be simple)
	- The slide leads and the speaker assists (usually for figures and tables)
- You'll probably switch between these modes multiple times throughout any presentation
- Other presentation tips:
	- Match what you are saying with what is being shown
	- Always motivate what you are telling the audience. Unmotivated details will end anyone's attention.
	- Explain the axes of a graph.
	- If you have a complex figure, highlight where you want people to look or gray out where you don't want them to look.
	- You don't have to write full sentences on slides.
	- One idea per slide.
	- Slow down.

# Managers as input/output machines

- Meeting with your manager is for telling your updates and getting feedback
	- Prepare your updates carefully
	- Do not expect good feedback from bad updates

- A few suggestions for running update meetings with your advisor/manager:
	- Assume they forgot everything that was said last meeting.
	- Show up with things to talk about and a goal.
	- In 3-4 sentences, refresh everyone's memory about the last meeting and what you were supposed to accomplish since then.
	- In 4-6 sentences, summarize what you did, what worked, what didn't work, and what you think you should do next. Think of this as bullet points.
	- Avoid diving into details until you know everyone is on the same page and caught up.
	- If possible, show up with something tangible, like a visual aid, a demo, a draft, or at least some notes.

# Daily progress tracking

- Each day, write down a few bullet points of what you did
- The benefits:
	- The next day, I can quickly resume working by looking at what I wrote yesterday.
	- When I feel like I am stuck, it is motivating to look back and see the progress.
	- It catalogs all of my efforts (what worked and what didn't).
	- **At the end of the week, I can summarize the daily bullet points to update my advisor/mentor/manager/team/lab.**
	- At the end of the month, I can summarize the weekly bullet points to track my progress towards bigger goals.
	- It makes it easy to update my resume/CV and to fill out performance reviews.
