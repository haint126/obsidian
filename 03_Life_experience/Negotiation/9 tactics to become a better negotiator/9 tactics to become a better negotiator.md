# Why you need to negotiate
- I don’t believe your pay is limited by a recession.
- It’s limited by:
	- The value you deliver.
	- How replaceable you are.
	- Your negotiating skills.
- In the US:
	- Average raise at the same job = 2%
	- Average raise hopping to new job= 30%
- It's a matter of millions.
- Find your win.

# 1. Entitlement vs Worth
- I've seen 20-year-olds demand $150k/yr for a job I paid the last guy to do for $70k.
- I've also seen brilliant people work for peanuts, afraid to admit their value.
- You aren’t OWED a raise.
- But it’s not selfish to want one if you earn it

# 2. Always. Ask.
- Average wage growth in the US over the past 5yrs is ~2%
- Tough in normal times.
- Downright abysmal with 10% inflation.
- Negotiated raises average 10-20%.
- Don’t ask & the answer is always no.

# 3. Assume You’ll Get a Yes
> "Never negotiate out of fear.
> But never fear to negotiate."
> –JFK

- Remove the fear from your ask.
- You become:
	- Logical
	- Thoughtful
	- More confident
	- Better at making a win-win

# 4. It's Relationship-Based
- Studies show 4 traits in successful negotiating:
	- Respect
	- Reliability
	- 2-way communication
	- Commitment to the other's interests
- Trust is the bedrock, not trickery.
- BONUS:
	- I've found that "being likable" gets you further than "being alpha."
	- I’ll even give you my magic fallback line if things go south:
		- “Can’t blame a girl for asking, can ya?”
		- *cue winning smile*
	- Works to defuse every single time.

# 5. Past & Future Hard Numbers
- Find & track KPIs your boss cares about.
- Bring specifics.
- 2 worst negotiation tactics:
	- No prep at all
	- “I have this new car payment and–”
- 2 best:
	- “I've already accomplished A B & C”
	- “I plan to accomplish X Y & Z in the next 6-12 months”

# 6. Personal vs Company Goals
- Pitch this framework to your boss:
- “It’s my personal goal to make $X this year.
- And I’d love to make 3x that for this company.
- I have (a list of specific goals) in mind.
- Is there anything else I would need to do to hit this number?”

# 7. Put Yourself in Your Boss’s Shoes
- Not enough money to go around?
- There's another course of action:
	- Incentives.
	- The idea is to link YOU making more $ with the COMPANY making more $
- In sales, this is easy:
	- X sales = X% commission.
- What does your role do that drives revenue?
- Pitch a payout linked to that (that your boss can get on board with)
	- Sign new client = X% of contract
	- Content = bonuses for virality
	- Marketing = X% of rev >$X

# 8. Negotiate the Non-Monetary
- Two steps to plan this:

	1. What do you value? (besides $)
	2. How can you get that, & make it a win for your boss, too?

		- Hit OKRs? Get Fridays off
		- Productivity at X? 100% remote
		- Project met a deadline? Extra PTO

# 9. Get a Move On
- I switched jobs every 2-ish years for most of my career.
- I negotiated up until I found the cap.
- Then I moved on to greener pastures.
