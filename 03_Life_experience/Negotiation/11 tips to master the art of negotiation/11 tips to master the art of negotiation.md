# 1. Prepare like a genius
- Study the desires of the other party.
- Learn what they need, what they want, and what they're willing to part ways with.
- Think through their problems and objectives, and how you'll tackle each of them.
- The other party won't be ready like you are.

# 2. Set up anchors
- When you make an initial offer, make the offer either:
	- Extremely high
	- Extremely low
- This contrast to the other party's expectations will make your real offer seem much more reasonable.
- The shock factor also gets them on their toes.

# 3. Be the first to move
- Traditional negotiation advice says the opposite.
- But when you are first to make your offer, you control the narrative of the meeting from the start.
- You can build out the conversation from there.
- This feeds in nicely with Anchoring as a tactic.

# 4. Ask thoughtful questions
- Avoid Yes/No queries.
- You want to get the other person talking so you can gather more info from them.
- Open-ended or questions that require some thought to answer work best.
- Ex.
	- "Why is that important to you?"
	- "What would a good solution be?"

# 5. Maintain positivity
- Negotiations don't need to be grim.
- In fact, the best meetings are upbeat and positive.
- If you can be positive while still tackling objections, you have the upper hand.
- This isn't about being mean, it's about finding a solution that works for everyone.

# 6. Address objections openly
- The other party will have objections to your proposals.
- Find out what those are.
- Know how to tackle and resolve them.
- Communicate your solutions openly in the meeting.
- Confrontation about objections will lead to fruitful conversation.

# 7. Mirror their energy level
- This is a psychological hack that works wonders.
- Pay attention to the other party's:
	- Body language
	- Verbal language
	- Speed of speech
	- Tone of voice
	- Volume
- And mirror it.
- They will feel more comfortable and open up more to you.

# 8. Aim for a win-win
- Negotiation is the art of letting someone else have your way.
- But they shouldn't walk away with nothing.
- Find a solution that is favorable for you, but still provides value to the other party.
- If you don't seek this, a resolution will be hard to find.

# 9. Be willing to walk away
- There is no greater advantage than being able to say "no" and mean it.
- If the other party sees that you are OK walking away, it will push them closer to your side.

# 10. Zero in on the problem
- You need to be extremely hard on the problem at hand, but not on the person.
- The problem is the enemy that needs to be extinguished.
- Seek to add value in negotiation by getting rid of problems.

# 11. Frame it as a collaboration
- No one wants to go into a "negotiation meeting".
- Frame it as a collaborative effort to find solutions together.
- You'll each have agendas, and you can discuss those openly in the meeting.
- At no point should this become a lecture.
