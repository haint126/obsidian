# What is a balance sheet
- A balance sheet is a snapshot of your business at a specific point in time, and
- It tells you whether your business is stable and financially healthy:
	- Is there cash
	- Can you pay your bills
	- How much debt do you have
	- What is the book value of the business

# The structure of a balance sheet
- The structure of a balance sheet is:

$$Assets = Liabilities + Equity$$

- A company has to pay for what it owns (assets) by either:
	- Borrowing money (liabilities), or
	- Bringing on investors (equity)

## Assets are What You Own
- Listed top to bottom in order of liquidity, which is how fast they can be converted to cash:
	- Cash
	- Inventory (goods available for sale)
	- Accounts receivable (what people owe you)
	- Fixed assets (land, machinery, equipment, and buildings)

## Liabilities are What You Owe
- Current liabilities are due within 1 year:
	- Accounts payable
	- Income tax payable
	- Current portion of debt
- Long-term liabilities are due at any point after that:
	- Long-term debt
	- Mortgages payable

## Equity is What You're Worth
- If you sold your assets and paid your liabilities, equity's what's left over:
	- Money contributed (common shares)
	- Profits taken out of the business (dividends)
	- Earnings retained in the business (retained earnings)
	- Balance Sheet Analysis

# Balance Sheet Analysis
- There are three types of ratios we'll review on the balance sheet:
	- Liquidity
	- Solvency
	- Profitability

## Liquidity Ratios
- Liquidity ratios show your ability to turn assets into cash and include:
	- Cash ratio
	- Quick ratio
	- Current ratio

## Solvency Ratios
- Solvency ratios show your ability to pay off debts and include:
	- Cash ratio
	- Quick ratio
	- Current ratio
	- Debt to equity
	- Interest coverage
	- Essential solvency ratio

## Profitability Ratios
- Profitability ratios show your ability to generate income from your balance sheet assets and include:
	- Return on assets
	- Return on equity
	- Return on invested capital
	- Return on capital employed

## Cash Ratio
- The cash ratio measures your total cash and cash equivalents against your total liabilities.
- It is an indicator of your value under a worst case scenario, such as a bankruptcy or business shutdown.
- A larger ratio is better.

## Quick Ratio
- The quick ratio measures your ability to meet your short-term obligations with your most liquid assets - also called the acid test ratio.
- A higher ratio = better liquidity and financial health.

## Current Ratio
- The current ratio measures your ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year, sometimes called the working capital ratio.
- A ratio less than one indicates any debts due within one year are greater than your current assets.

## Debt to Equity
- The debt-to-equity ratio compares total liabilities against total equity, and
- It's used to evaluate how much leverage you're using in your business.
	- Less than 1 = safe
	- Greater than 2 = risky
- Debt-to-equity is heavily dependent on the industry.
