# TLDR
- You can create passive income through:
	- REITs
	- Business Income
	- Dividend Stocks Income
	- Covered Call Options Income

# 1. REITs
- A REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) allows you to invest in real estate without the need to own property.
	- REITs offer a way to invest in real estate without the hassle of being a landlord.
	- Real estate investors provide the capital for an investment and let professionals manage the REIT on their behalf.
	- REIT investors earn passive income in the form of dividends.
- Basically when you invest in a REIT, you are purchasing shares in a company which owns real estate.
	- When you invest in a REIT, you don't own any property, you own shares of the company that owns the property.
	- REITs commonly invest in multiple investment properties, which gives the REIT’s a diverse real estate investment portfolio and reduces risks.
	- REITS are a great way to gain exposure to high-yield dividends, and a great way to gain exposure to the Real Estate sector.
- REITs have delivered an average return of 11% from 1980.
- You can invest in REITs 3 different ways:
	1. (1) You can buy a REIT Index Fund/ ETF,
	2. (2) You can buy individual publicly traded REITs on the stock market,
	3. (3) You can invest with others into private REITs
- You can find REITs for every sector, such as real estate in:
	- Malls
	- Retail
	- Storage
	- Casinos
	- Industrial
	- Healthcare
	- Cell Towers
	- Apartments
	- Data Centers

# 2. Business income:
- If you can work 40+ hours a week for someone, then you can work at least 1 hour a day for yourself.
	- Create multiple steams of income from a side-business or side-hustle, so that working 40+ hours a week becomes a choice, not an obligation.
	- Always use strategic tax planning to maximize your income.
- As a business owner, you can deduct everyday expenses if they are used for business purposes. Examples include:
	- Rent
	- Wifi
	- Electricity
	- Cell phone bill
	- Business meals
	- Vehicle expenses
	- Home office deduction
- If you can work 8+ hours a day for someone else, you can use your evenings to work on a side-hustle, side business or learning new skills which you can be paid for.
	- Use the 5-9 to replace your 9-5.
	- Many income generating hobbies or skills that people know or can learn have been replaced by scrolling social media for hours.
	- Time is your greatest asset, you do not get back lost time.
	- Create additional income from a side hustle or side business, and retire early.

# 3. Dividend stocks income:
- Dividends are payments that a company makes to share profits with its stockholders.
- Dividend yield is the dividend per share / stock price, and is expressed a percentage.
- [$SCHD](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SCHD) is my favorite dividend index fund because it only invests in dividend stocks:
	- That paid investors every year for at least 10 years
	- Whose shares have significant daily trading volume
	- Whose companies have the best relative financial strength

# 4. Covered call option income:
- Trading options is how you make money when the markets trade sideways or are down trending.
- There are so many opportunities to profit with options, but you should also understand the risks!
- Options can make you a lot of money when used correctly and can also be very harmful if used incorrectly.
- Call options & put options provide a range of strategies for hedging, income or speculation. Options may seem overwhelming at first, but it's easy after you know the basics
